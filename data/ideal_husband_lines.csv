MRS,MARCHMONT,1
MRS,CHEVELEY,2
MRS,CHEVELEY Indeed?  I have forgotten all about my schooldays.  I have a vague impression that they were detestable.,38
MRS,"CHEVELEY I thought your frock so charming last night, Miss Chiltern.  So simple and . . . suitable.",548
MRS,"CHEVELEY No, lady Markby—a ruby.",572
MRS,CHEVELEY I have never read a Blue Book.  I prefer books . . . in yellow covers.,586
MRS,"CHEVELEY I don’t mind waiting in the carriage at all, provided there is somebody to look at one.",600
MRS,CHEVELEY Really?,609
MRS,CHEVELEY Then life has taught you nothing?,613
MRS,"CHEVELEY Do you know, Gertrude, I don’t mind your talking morality a bit.  Morality is simply the attitude we adopt towards people whom we personally dislike.  You dislike me.  I am quite aware of that.  And I have always detested you.  And yet I have come here to do you a service.",619
MRS,CHEVELEY In this world like meets with like.  It is because your husband is himself fraudulent and dishonest that we pair so well together.  Between you and him there are chasms.  He and I are closer than friends.  We are enemies linked together.  The same sin binds us.,627
MRS. MARCHMONT,"Going on to the Hartlocks’ to-night, Margaret?",3
MRS. MARCHMONT,"Yes.  Horribly tedious parties they give, don’t they?",5
MRS. MARCHMONT,I come here to be educated.,7
MRS. MARCHMONT,"So do I.  It puts one almost on a level with the commercial classes, doesn’t it?  But dear Gertrude Chiltern is always telling me that I should have some serious purpose in life.  So I come here to try to find one.",9
MRS. MARCHMONT,How very trivial of him!,11
MRS. MARCHMONT,About myself.,13
MRS. MARCHMONT,Not in the smallest degree.,15
MRS. MARCHMONT,"And how well it becomes us, Olivia!",17
MRS. MARCHMONT,Our husbands never appreciate anything in us.  We have to go to others for that!,158
MRS. MARCHMONT,"That is exactly what we can’t stand.  My Reginald is quite hopelessly faultless.  He is really unendurably so, at times! There is not the smallest element of excitement in knowing him.",161
MRS. MARCHMONT,"My poor Olivia! We have married perfect husbands, and we are well punished for it.",164
MRS. MARCHMONT,"Oh, dear no!  They are as happy as possible!  And as for trusting us, it is tragic how much they trust us.",166
MRS. MARCHMONT,"I am afraid Lord Goring is in the camp of the enemy, as usual.  I saw him talking to that Mrs. Cheveley when he came in.",170
MRS. MARCHMONT,"Well, we are not going to praise her.  I hear she went to the Opera on Monday night, and told Tommy Rufford at supper that, as far as she could see, London Society was entirely made up of dowdies and dandies.",174
MRS. MARCHMONT,Oh! do you really think that is what Mrs. Cheveley meant?,176
MRS. MARCHMONT,"I like looking at geniuses, and listening to beautiful people.",180
MRS. MARCHMONT,"I am so glad to hear you say that.  Marchmont and I have been married for seven years, and he has never once told me that I was morbid.  Men are so painfully unobservant!",182
MRS. MARCHMONT,"Ah! but you are always sympathetic, Olivia!",184
MRS. MARCHMONT,"Olivia, I have a curious feeling of absolute faintness. I think I should like some supper very much.  I know I should like some supper.",192
MRS. MARCHMONT,"Men are so horribly selfish, they never think of these things.",194
MRS. MARCHMONT,"Thank you, Mr. Montford, I never touch supper.  But I will sit beside you, and watch you.",201
MRS. MARCHMONT,Then I will watch some one else.,203
MRS. MARCHMONT,"Pray, Mr. Montford, do not make these painful scenes of jealousy in public!",205
LADY BASILDON,I suppose so.  Are you?,4
LADY BASILDON,Horribly tedious!  Never know why I go.  Never know why I go anywhere.,6
LADY BASILDON,Ah! I hate being educated!,8
LADY BASILDON,I don’t see anybody here to-night whom one could possibly call a serious purpose. The man who took me in to dinner talked to me about his wife the whole time.,10
LADY BASILDON,Terribly trivial!  What did your man talk about?,12
LADY BASILDON,And were you interested?,14
LADY BASILDON,"What martyrs we are, dear Margaret!",16
LADY BASILDON,Are you here?  I had no idea you ever came to political parties!,151
LADY BASILDON,I delight in talking politics.  I talk them all day long. But I can’t bear listening to them.  I don’t know how the unfortunate men in the House stand these long debates.,153
LADY BASILDON,Really?,155
LADY BASILDON,"Ah! that accounts for so much in men that I have never understood, and so much in women that their husbands never appreciate in them!",157
LADY BASILDON,"Yes, always to others, have we not?",159
LADY BASILDON,Basildon is quite as bad; he is as domestic as if he was a bachelor.,163
LADY BASILDON,Perfectly tragic!,167
LADY BASILDON,"Certainly not comic, Lord Goring.  How unkind of you to suggest such a thing!",169
LADY BASILDON,Please don’t praise other women in our presence.  You might wait for us to do that!,172
LADY BASILDON,What a horrid combination!  So very unnatural!,179
LADY BASILDON,"I have always said, dear Margaret, that you were the most morbid person in London.",183
LADY BASILDON,"I am positively dying for supper, Margaret!",193
LADY BASILDON,"Men are grossly material, grossly material!",195
LADY BASILDON,"I never take supper, thank you, Vicomte. But I will come down with you with pleasure.",197
LADY BASILDON,"You look quite English, Vicomte, quite English.",199
MASON,Mr. and Lady Jane Barford.  Lord Caversham.,18
MASON,Lady Markby.  Mrs. Cheveley.,32
MASON,Lord Goring.,101
MASON,"Yes, Sir Robert.",450
MASON,"Yes, Sir Robert.",452
MASON,Lady Markby.  Mrs. Cheveley.,544
MASON,"No, my lady.",575
MASON,Lord Caversham.,1106
MASON,"Luncheon is on the table, my Lady!",1186
LORD CAVERSHAM,"Good evening, Lady Chiltern!  Has my good-for-nothing young son been here?",19
LORD CAVERSHAM,Because he leads such an idle life.,22
LORD CAVERSHAM,You are a very charming young lady!,24
LORD CAVERSHAM,Never go anywhere now.  Sick of London Society. Shouldn’t mind being introduced to my own tailor; he always votes on the right side.  But object strongly to being sent down to dinner with my wife’s milliner.  Never could stand Lady Caversham’s bonnets.,26
LORD CAVERSHAM,"Hum!  Which is Goring?  Beautiful idiot, or the other thing?",28
LORD CAVERSHAM,Into what?,30
LORD CAVERSHAM,"Well, sir! what are you doing here?  Wasting your life as usual!  You should be in bed, sir.  You keep too late hours!  I heard of you the other night at Lady Rufford’s dancing till four o’clock in the morning!",143
LORD CAVERSHAM,"Can’t make out how you stand London Society.  The thing has gone to the dogs, a lot of damned nobodies talking about nothing.",145
LORD CAVERSHAM,You seem to me to be living entirely for pleasure.,147
LORD CAVERSHAM,"You are heartless, sir, very heartless!",149
LORD CAVERSHAM,Take my cloak off.,673
LORD CAVERSHAM,"Of course it is worth while, sir.  Which is the most comfortable chair?",675
LORD CAVERSHAM,"Thank ye.  No draught, I hope, in this room?",677
LORD CAVERSHAM,Glad to hear it.  Can’t stand draughts.  No draughts at home.,679
LORD CAVERSHAM,"Eh?  Eh?  Don’t understand what you mean.  Want to have a serious conversation with you, sir.",681
LORD CAVERSHAM,"Well, sir, it is only ten o’clock.  What is your objection to the hour?  I think the hour is an admirable hour!",683
LORD CAVERSHAM,"What do you mean, sir?",685
LORD CAVERSHAM,"Well, make it Tuesday, sir, make it Tuesday.",687
LORD CAVERSHAM,"Talk in your sleep, sir?  What does that matter?  You are not married.",689
LORD CAVERSHAM,"Hum!  That is what I have come to talk to you about, sir.  You have got to get married, and at once.  Why, when I was your age, sir, I had been an inconsolable widower for three months, and was already paying my addresses to your admirable mother.  Damme, sir, it is your duty to get married.  You can’t be always living for pleasure. Every man of position is married nowadays.  Bachelors are not fashionable any more.  They are a damaged lot.  Too much is known about them.  You must get a wife, sir.  Look where your friend Robert Chiltern has got to by probity, hard work, and a sensible marriage with a good woman.  Why don’t you imitate him, sir?  Why don’t you take him for your model?",691
LORD CAVERSHAM,"I wish you would, sir.  Then I should be happy.  At present I make your mother’s life miserable on your account.  You are heartless, sir, quite heartless.",693
LORD CAVERSHAM,"And it is high time for you to get married.  You are thirty-four years of age, sir.",695
LORD CAVERSHAM,"I tell you you are thirty-four, sir.  And there is a draught in your room, besides, which makes your conduct worse.  Why did you tell me there was no draught, sir?  I feel a draught, sir, I feel it distinctly.",697
LORD CAVERSHAM,"No, sir; I have called this evening for a definite purpose, and I am going to see it through at all costs to my health or yours.  Put down my cloak, sir.",699
LORD CAVERSHAM,"Well, sir, I suppose I have a right to sneeze when I choose?",703
LORD CAVERSHAM,"Oh, damn sympathy.  There is a great deal too much of that sort of thing going on nowadays.",705
LORD CAVERSHAM,"That is a paradox, sir.  I hate paradoxes.",707
LORD CAVERSHAM,"Do you always really understand what you say, sir?",709
LORD CAVERSHAM,If you listen attentively! . . . Conceited young puppy!,711
LORD CAVERSHAM,"Well, sir? am I to wait attendance on you?",719
LORD CAVERSHAM,"That is a matter for me, sir.  You would probably make a very poor choice.  It is I who should be consulted, not you.  There is property at stake.  It is not a matter for affection. Affection comes later on in married life.",742
LORD CAVERSHAM,"Certainly, sir.  I mean certainly not, sir.  You are talking very foolishly to-night.  What I say is that marriage is a matter for common sense.",744
LORD CAVERSHAM,"No woman, plain or pretty, has any common sense at all, sir.  Common sense is the privilege of our sex.",746
LORD CAVERSHAM,"I use it, sir.  I use nothing else.",748
LORD CAVERSHAM,"It is the secret of your mother’s happiness.  You are very heartless, sir, very heartless.",750
LORD CAVERSHAM,"Well, sir, what are you doing here?  Wasting your time as usual, I suppose?",944
LORD CAVERSHAM,Have you been thinking over what I spoke to you about last night?,946
LORD CAVERSHAM,Engaged to be married yet?,948
LORD CAVERSHAM,You can have till dinner-time if it would be of any convenience to you.,950
LORD CAVERSHAM,Humph!  Never know when you are serious or not.,952
LORD CAVERSHAM,I suppose you have read _The Times_ this morning?,954
LORD CAVERSHAM,Do you mean to say you have not read _The Times_ leading article on Robert Chiltern’s career?,956
LORD CAVERSHAM,"What should it say, sir?  Everything complimentary, of course.  Chiltern’s speech last night on this Argentine Canal scheme was one of the finest pieces of oratory ever delivered in the House since Canning.",958
LORD CAVERSHAM,"Uphold it, sir?  How little you know him!  Why, he denounced it roundly, and the whole system of modern political finance. This speech is the turning-point in his career, as _The Times_ points out.  You should read this article, sir.  ‘Sir Robert Chiltern . . . most rising of our young statesmen . . . Brilliant Orator . . . Unblemished career . . . Well-known integrity of character . . . Represents what is best in English public life . . . Noble contrast to the lax morality so common among foreign politicians.’  They will never say that of you, sir.",960
LORD CAVERSHAM,"He has got more than pluck, sir, he has got genius.",962
LORD CAVERSHAM,I wish you would go into Parliament.,964
LORD CAVERSHAM,Why don’t you try to do something useful in life?,966
LORD CAVERSHAM,"I hate this affectation of youth, sir.  It is a great deal too prevalent nowadays.",968
LORD CAVERSHAM,Why don’t you propose to that pretty Miss Chiltern?,970
LORD CAVERSHAM,I don’t suppose there is the smallest chance of her accepting you.,972
LORD CAVERSHAM,If she did accept you she would be the prettiest fool in England.,974
LORD CAVERSHAM,"You don’t deserve her, sir.",976
LORD CAVERSHAM,"Lady Caversham is as usual, as usual.",979
LORD CAVERSHAM,"They have had a serious relapse, I am sorry to say.",982
LORD CAVERSHAM,"If it is, we shall have to give Lady Caversham a narcotic.  Otherwise she would never consent to have a feather touched.",985
LORD CAVERSHAM,"You are quite right, my dear, quite right . . . as far as he is concerned, I mean.",990
LORD CAVERSHAM,"I regret to say, Miss Chiltern, that I have no influence at all over my son.  I wish I had.  If I had, I know what I would make him do.",992
LORD CAVERSHAM,"He is very heartless, very heartless.",994
LORD CAVERSHAM,"After that, my dear, I really must bid you good morning.",998
LORD CAVERSHAM,I am afraid I can’t take him with me to Downing Street. It is not the Prime Minster’s day for seeing the unemployed.,1000
LORD CAVERSHAM,"Good morning, Lady Chiltern!  Warmest congratulations to you, Chiltern, on your brilliant speech last night.  I have just left the Prime Minister, and you are to have the vacant seat in the Cabinet.",1108
LORD CAVERSHAM,Yes; here is the Prime Minister’s letter.,1110
LORD CAVERSHAM,"Certainly, and you well deserve it too.  You have got what we want so much in political life nowadays—high character, high moral tone, high principles.  Everything that you have not got, sir, and never will have.",1112
LORD CAVERSHAM,"Decline it, sir!",1115
LORD CAVERSHAM,"Decline a seat in the Cabinet, and retire from public life?  Never heard such damned nonsense in the whole course of my existence.  I beg your pardon, Lady Chiltern.  Chiltern, I beg your pardon.  Don’t grin like that, sir.",1117
LORD CAVERSHAM,"Lady Chiltern, you are a sensible woman, the most sensible woman in London, the most sensible woman I know.  Will you kindly prevent your husband from making such a . . . from taking such . . . Will you kindly do that, Lady Chiltern?",1119
LORD CAVERSHAM,You approve of it?  Good heavens!,1121
LORD CAVERSHAM,"What is the matter with this family?  Something wrong here, eh?  Idiocy?  Hereditary, I suppose. Both of them, too.  Wife as well as husband.  Very sad.  Very sad indeed! And they are not an old family.  Can’t understand it.",1126
LORD CAVERSHAM,"What is it then, sir?",1128
LORD CAVERSHAM,Hate these new-fangled names.  Same thing as we used to call idiocy fifty years ago.  Shan’t stay in this house any longer.,1130
LORD CAVERSHAM,"What, sir?",1132
LORD CAVERSHAM,"What about, sir?",1134
LORD CAVERSHAM,Not a subject on which much eloquence is possible.,1136
LORD CAVERSHAM,"What does this mean, sir? You don’t mean to say that this charming, clever young lady has been so foolish as to accept you?",1183
LORD CAVERSHAM,"I am very glad to hear that, Chiltern . . . I congratulate you, sir.  If the country doesn’t go to the dogs or the Radicals, we shall have you Prime Minister, some day.",1185
LORD CAVERSHAM,"With pleasure, and I’ll drive you down to Downing Street afterwards, Chiltern.  You have a great future before you, a great future.  Wish I could say the same for you, sir. But your career will have to be entirely domestic.",1188
LORD CAVERSHAM,"And if you don’t make this young lady an ideal husband, I’ll cut you off with a shilling.",1190
LORD CAVERSHAM,"What do you want him to be then, dear?",1192
LORD CAVERSHAM,"Upon my word, there is a good deal of common sense in that, Lady Chiltern.",1194
LADY CHILTERN,I don’t think Lord Goring has arrived yet.,20
LADY CHILTERN,I think Mrs. Cheveley and I have met before.  I did not know she had married a second time.,34
LADY CHILTERN,"We were at school together, Mrs. Cheveley.",37
LADY CHILTERN,I am not surprised!,39
LADY CHILTERN,"I hardly think there will be much in common between you and my husband, Mrs. Cheveley!",41
LADY CHILTERN,"Why did you wish to meet my husband, Mrs. Cheveley?",280
LADY CHILTERN,There must be some mistake.  That scheme could never have my husband’s support.,282
LADY CHILTERN,A secret?  Between whom?,284
LADY CHILTERN,"Good-night, dear!  You saw whom Lady Markby brought here to-night?",309
LADY CHILTERN,"Apparently to try and lure Robert to uphold some fraudulent scheme in which she is interested.  The Argentine Canal, in fact.",311
LADY CHILTERN,She is incapable of understanding an upright nature like my husband’s!,313
LADY CHILTERN,I don’t call women of that kind clever.  I call them stupid!,315
LADY CHILTERN,Good-night!,317
LADY CHILTERN,"Robert, it is not true, is it?  You are not going to lend your support to this Argentine speculation?  You couldn’t!",321
LADY CHILTERN,"That woman who has just gone out, Mrs. Cheveley, as she calls herself now.  She seemed to taunt me with it.  Robert, I know this woman.  You don’t.  We were at school together.  She was untruthful, dishonest, an evil influence on every one whose trust or friendship she could win.  I hated, I despised her.  She stole things, she was a thief. She was sent away for being a thief.  Why do you let her influence you?",323
LADY CHILTERN,One’s past is what one is.  It is the only way by which people should be judged.,325
LADY CHILTERN,"It is a true saying, Robert.  And what did she mean by boasting that she had got you to lend your support, your name, to a thing I have heard you describe as the most dishonest and fraudulent scheme there has ever been in political life?",327
LADY CHILTERN,"But you told me yesterday that you had received the report from the Commission, and that it entirely condemned the whole thing.",329
LADY CHILTERN,They should both represent man at his highest.  I see no difference between them.,331
LADY CHILTERN,All!,333
LADY CHILTERN,"Robert!  Oh! it is horrible that I should have to ask you such a question—Robert, are you telling me the whole truth?",335
LADY CHILTERN,Why do you not answer it?,337
LADY CHILTERN,"Compromise?  Robert, why do you talk so differently to-night from the way I have always heard you talk?  Why are you changed?",339
LADY CHILTERN,Circumstances should never alter principles!,341
LADY CHILTERN,What?,343
LADY CHILTERN,"It can never be necessary to do what is not honourable. Or if it be necessary, then what is it that I have loved!  But it is not, Robert; tell me it is not.  Why should it be?  What gain would you get? Money?  We have no need of that!  And money that comes from a tainted source is a degradation.  Power?  But power is nothing in itself.  It is power to do good that is fine—that, and that only.  What is it, then? Robert, tell me why you are going to do this dishonourable thing!",345
LADY CHILTERN,"Robert, that is all very well for other men, for men who treat life simply as a sordid speculation; but not for you, Robert, not for you.  You are different.  All your life you have stood apart from others.  You have never let the world soil you.  To the world, as to myself, you have been an ideal always.  Oh! be that ideal still.  That great inheritance throw not away—that tower of ivory do not destroy. Robert, men can love what is beneath them—things unworthy, stained, dishonoured.  We women worship when we love; and when we lose our worship, we lose everything.  Oh! don’t kill my love for you, don’t kill that!",347
LADY CHILTERN,"I know that there are men with horrible secrets in their lives—men who have done some shameful thing, and who in some critical moment have to pay for it, by doing some other act of shame—oh! don’t tell me you are such as they are!  Robert, is there in your life any secret dishonour or disgrace?  Tell me, tell me at once, that—",349
LADY CHILTERN,That our lives may drift apart.,351
LADY CHILTERN,That they may be entirely separate.  It would be better for us both.,353
LADY CHILTERN,"I was sure of it, Robert, I was sure of it.  But why did you say those dreadful things, things so unlike your real self?  Don’t let us ever talk about the subject again.  You will write, won’t you, to Mrs. Cheveley, and tell her that you cannot support this scandalous scheme of hers?  If you have given her any promise you must take it back, that is all!",355
LADY CHILTERN,"Surely, Robert!  What else is there to do?",357
LADY CHILTERN,"You must never see her again, Robert.  She is not a woman you should ever speak to.  She is not worthy to talk to a man like you. No; you must write to her at once, now, this moment, and let your letter show her that your decision is quite irrevocable!",359
LADY CHILTERN,Yes.,361
LADY CHILTERN,"That makes no matter.  She must know at once that she has been mistaken in you—and that you are not a man to do anything base or underhand or dishonourable.  Write here, Robert.  Write that you decline to support this scheme of hers, as you hold it to be a dishonest scheme. Yes—write the word dishonest.  She knows what that word means.  Yes; that will do.  And now the envelope.  Have this letter sent at once to Claridge’s Hotel.  There is no answer.  Robert, love gives one an instinct to things.  I feel to-night that I have saved you from something that might have been a danger to you, from something that might have made men honour you less than they do.  I don’t think you realise sufficiently, Robert, that you have brought into the political life of our time a nobler atmosphere, a finer attitude towards life, a freer air of purer aims and higher ideals—I know it, and for that I love you, Robert.",363
LADY CHILTERN,"I will love you always, because you will always be worthy of love.  We needs must love the highest when we see it!",365
LADY CHILTERN,"Good afternoon, Lord Goring!",461
LADY CHILTERN,"No; I have just come from the Woman’s Liberal Association, where, by the way, Robert, your name was received with loud applause, and now I have come in to have my tea. You will wait and have some tea, won’t you?",463
LADY CHILTERN,I will be back in a moment.  I am only going to take my hat off.,465
LADY CHILTERN,"We have much more important work to do than look at each other’s bonnets, Lord Goring.",467
LADY CHILTERN,"Oh! dull, useful, delightful things, Factory Acts, Female Inspectors, the Eight Hours’ Bill, the Parliamentary Franchise. . . . Everything, in fact, that you would find thoroughly uninteresting.",469
LADY CHILTERN,"Never bonnets, never!",471
LADY CHILTERN,"You are not going, Robert?",479
LADY CHILTERN,"You work too hard, Robert.  You seem never to think of yourself, and you are looking so tired.",481
LADY CHILTERN,"Do sit down.  I am so glad you have called.  I want to talk to you about . . . well, not about bonnets, or the Woman’s Liberal Association.  You take far too much interest in the first subject, and not nearly enough in the second.",483
LADY CHILTERN,"Yes.  You have guessed it.  After you left last night I found out that what she had said was really true.  Of course I made Robert write her a letter at once, withdrawing his promise.",485
LADY CHILTERN,"To have kept it would have been the first stain on a career that has been stainless always.  Robert must be above reproach. He is not like other men.  He cannot afford to do what other men do. Don’t you agree with me?  You are Robert’s greatest friend.  You are our greatest friend, Lord Goring.  No one, except myself, knows Robert better than you do.  He has no secrets from me, and I don’t think he has any from you.",487
LADY CHILTERN,Then am I not right in my estimate of him?  I know I am right.  But speak to me frankly.,489
LADY CHILTERN,"Surely.  You have nothing to conceal, have you?",491
LADY CHILTERN,"Of which you know so little, Lord Goring—",493
LADY CHILTERN,Well?,495
LADY CHILTERN,"I hope so.  Why do you look at me so strangely, Lord Goring?",497
LADY CHILTERN,What do you mean by a foolish letter?,499
LADY CHILTERN,Robert is as incapable of doing a foolish thing as he is of doing a wrong thing.,501
LADY CHILTERN,Are you a Pessimist?  What will the other dandies say? They will all have to go into mourning.,503
LADY CHILTERN,"Lord Goring, you are talking quite seriously.  I don’t think I ever heard you talk seriously before.",505
LADY CHILTERN,But I like you to be serious.,507
LADY CHILTERN,I am sure Mr. Trafford will be able to give you one.,520
LADY CHILTERN,Yes; but I don’t know why you said it to me.,524
LADY CHILTERN,What has poor Mr. Trafford done this time?  Robert says he is the best secretary he has ever had.,534
LADY CHILTERN,"Dear Mabel, don’t talk like that.  Besides, Robert thinks very highly of Mr. Trafford.  He believes he has a brilliant future before him.",536
LADY CHILTERN,Mabel!,538
LADY CHILTERN,Mrs. Cheveley!  Coming to see me? Impossible!,540
LADY CHILTERN,"You need not wait, Mabel.  Remember, Lady Basildon is expecting you.",542
LADY CHILTERN,"Dear Lady Markby, how nice of you to come and see me!  Won’t you sit down, Mrs. Cheveley?",545
LADY CHILTERN,"Mabel, Mrs. Cheveley wishes to know you.",547
LADY CHILTERN,Here?,562
LADY CHILTERN,I have heard nothing about it.  But I will send for the butler and ask.,564
LADY CHILTERN,"What sort of a brooch was it that you lost, Mrs. Cheveley?",569
LADY CHILTERN,"Has a ruby and diamond brooch been found in any of the rooms this morning, Mason?",574
LADY CHILTERN,"Oh, it has been no inconvenience.  That will do, Mason.  You can bring tea.",577
LADY CHILTERN,"Ah! it is heresy to say that in this house, Lady Markby. Robert is a great champion of the Higher Education of Women, and so, I am afraid, am I.",579
LADY CHILTERN,"But I am very much interested in politics, Lady Markby. I love to hear Robert talk about them.",584
LADY CHILTERN,"May I give you some tea, Mrs. Cheveley?",590
LADY CHILTERN,"Some tea, Lady Markby?",592
LADY CHILTERN,"Just slightly.  She was staying at Langton last autumn, when we were there.",598
LADY CHILTERN,"Robert and I are dining at home by ourselves to-night, and I don’t think I shall go anywhere afterwards.  Robert, of course, will have to be in the House.  But there is nothing interesting on.",605
LADY CHILTERN,"Mrs. Cheveley, I think it is right to tell you quite frankly that, had I known who you really were, I should not have invited you to my house last night.",608
LADY CHILTERN,I could not have done so.,610
LADY CHILTERN,I never change.,612
LADY CHILTERN,"It has taught me that a person who has once been guilty of a dishonest and dishonourable action may be guilty of it a second time, and should be shunned.",614
LADY CHILTERN,"Yes, to every one, without exception.",616
LADY CHILTERN,"You see now, I was sure, that for many reasons any further acquaintance between us during your stay in London is quite impossible?",618
LADY CHILTERN,"Like the service you wished to render my husband last night, I suppose.  Thank heaven, I saved him from that.",620
LADY CHILTERN,Yes.,622
LADY CHILTERN,This fraudulent speculation—,624
LADY CHILTERN,You are impertinent. What has my husband to do with you?  With a woman like you?,626
LADY CHILTERN,How dare you class my husband with yourself?  How dare you threaten him or me?  Leave my house.  You are unfit to enter it.,628
LADY CHILTERN,It is not true!  Robert!  It is not true!,630
LADY CHILTERN,"You sold a Cabinet secret for money!  You began your life with fraud!  You built up your career on dishonour!  Oh, tell me it is not true!  Lie to me!  Lie to me!  Tell me it is not true!",635
LADY CHILTERN,Don’t come near me.  Don’t touch me.  I feel as if you had soiled me for ever.  Oh! what a mask you have been wearing all these years!  A horrible painted mask!  You sold yourself for money.  Oh! a common thief were better.  You put yourself up to sale to the highest bidder!  You were bought in the market.  You lied to the whole world. And yet you will not lie to me.,637
LADY CHILTERN,"No, don’t speak!  Say nothing!  Your voice wakes terrible memories—memories of things that made me love you—memories of words that made me love you—memories that now are horrible to me.  And how I worshipped you!  You were to me something apart from common life, a thing pure, noble, honest, without stain.  The world seemed to me finer because you were in it, and goodness more real because you lived.  And now—oh, when I think that I made of a man like you my ideal! the ideal of my life!",639
LADY CHILTERN,"Good morning, dear!  How pretty you are looking!",1039
LADY CHILTERN,"Good morning, Lord Goring!",1041
LADY CHILTERN,Safe!  Oh! I am so glad of that.  What a good friend you are to him—to us!,1047
LADY CHILTERN,Who is that?,1049
LADY CHILTERN,I?  In danger?  What do you mean?,1051
LADY CHILTERN,"Well, what use is it to her?  Why should she not have it?",1053
LADY CHILTERN,"But what construction could she put on it? . . . Oh! not that! not that!  If I in—in trouble, and wanting your help, trusting you, propose to come to you . . . that you may advise me . . . assist me . . . Oh! are there women so horrible as that . . .?  And she proposes to send it to my husband?  Tell me what happened.  Tell me all that happened.",1055
LADY CHILTERN,At what hour did this happen?,1057
LADY CHILTERN,"You want me to tell Robert that the woman you expected was not Mrs. Cheveley, but myself?  That it was I whom you thought was concealed in a room in your house, at half-past ten o’clock at night?  You want me to tell him that?",1059
LADY CHILTERN,"Oh, I couldn’t, I couldn’t!",1061
LADY CHILTERN,No.,1063
LADY CHILTERN,No.  The letter must be intercepted.  That is all.  But how can I do it?  Letters arrive for him every moment of the day.  His secretaries open them and hand them to him.  I dare not ask the servants to bring me his letters.  It would be impossible.  Oh! why don’t you tell me what to do?,1065
LADY CHILTERN,Yes.,1067
LADY CHILTERN,"No.  Mr. Montford, I think.",1069
LADY CHILTERN,Oh! how do I know?,1071
LADY CHILTERN,I think so.,1073
LADY CHILTERN,I suppose so.,1075
LADY CHILTERN,Yes.,1077
LADY CHILTERN,Oh! you have saved his life; what have you done with mine?,1079
LADY CHILTERN,Yes.,1081
LADY CHILTERN,Yes.,1083
LADY CHILTERN,Because I loved you.,1085
LADY CHILTERN,"There is no disgrace in store for you, nor any public shame.  Mrs. Cheveley has handed over to Lord Goring the document that was in her possession, and he has destroyed it.",1087
LADY CHILTERN,Yes; Lord Goring has just told me.,1089
LADY CHILTERN,He burned it.,1091
LADY CHILTERN,Yes; he is in the conservatory.,1093
LADY CHILTERN,Public honour has been the result.,1095
LADY CHILTERN,"Oh yes, Robert, you should do that.  It is your duty to do that.",1097
LADY CHILTERN,No; it will be much to gain.,1099
LADY CHILTERN,"Oh! none, Robert.",1101
LADY CHILTERN,"Oh, my ambition!  I have none now, but that we two may love each other.  It was your ambition that led you astray.  Let us not talk about ambition.",1103
LADY CHILTERN,"I think my husband is right in his determination, Lord Caversham.  I approve of it.",1120
LADY CHILTERN,"I admire him for it.  I admire him immensely for it.  I have never admired him so much before. He is finer than even I thought him.  You will go and write your letter to the Prime Minister now, won’t you? Don’t hesitate about it, Robert.",1122
LADY CHILTERN,"I may come with you, Robert, may I not?",1124
LADY CHILTERN,I don’t understand you.,1139
LADY CHILTERN,Lord Goring?,1141
LADY CHILTERN,But it is my husband himself who wishes to retire from public life.  He feels it is his duty. It was he who first said so.,1143
LADY CHILTERN,We have both been punished.  I set him up too high.,1145
LADY CHILTERN,Let me see it.,1148
LADY CHILTERN,"A man’s life is of more value than a woman’s.  It has larger issues, wider scope, greater ambitions.  Our lives revolve in curves of emotions.  It is upon lines of intellect that a man’s life progresses.  I have just learnt this, and much else with it, from Lord Goring.  And I will not spoil your life for you, nor see you spoil it as a sacrifice to me, a useless sacrifice!",1150
LADY CHILTERN,You can forget.  Men easily forget.  And I forgive.  That is how women help the world.  I see that now.,1152
LADY CHILTERN,"Oh, I am so glad!  I am so glad!",1157
LADY CHILTERN,"Robert, if they love each other, why should they not be married?",1165
LADY CHILTERN,"Robert, it was not Mrs. Cheveley whom Lord Goring expected last night.",1172
LADY CHILTERN,"It was your own wife.  Robert, yesterday afternoon Lord Goring told me that if ever I was in trouble I could come to him for help, as he was our oldest and best friend.  Later on, after that terrible scene in this room, I wrote to him telling him that I trusted him, that I had need of him, that I was coming to him for help and advice. Yes, that letter.  I didn’t go to Lord Goring’s, after all.  I felt that it is from ourselves alone that help can come.  Pride made me think that. Mrs. Cheveley went.  She stole my letter and sent it anonymously to you this morning, that you should think . . . Oh! Robert, I cannot tell you what she wished you to think. . . .",1175
LADY CHILTERN,Let me write yours.  It is you I trust and need.  You and none else.,1177
LADY CHILTERN,No; you shall have Mabel.,1179
LADY CHILTERN,"Aren’t you coming in, Robert?",1195
LADY CHILTERN,"It is love, Robert.  Love, and only love.  For both of us a new life is beginning.",1197
MABEL CHILTERN,Why do you call Lord Goring good-for-nothing?,21
MABEL CHILTERN,"How can you say such a thing?  Why, he rides in the Row at ten o’clock in the morning, goes to the Opera three times a week, changes his clothes at least five times a day, and dines out every night of the season.  You don’t call that leading an idle life, do you?",23
MABEL CHILTERN,"How sweet of you to say that, Lord Caversham!  Do come to us more often.  You know we are always at home on Wednesdays, and you look so well with your star!",25
MABEL CHILTERN,"Oh, I love London Society!  I think it has immensely improved.  It is entirely composed now of beautiful idiots and brilliant lunatics.  Just what Society should be.",27
MABEL CHILTERN,I have been obliged for the present to put Lord Goring into a class quite by himself.  But he is developing charmingly!,29
MABEL CHILTERN,"I hope to let you know very soon, Lord Caversham!",31
MABEL CHILTERN,You are very late!,115
MABEL CHILTERN,Awfully!,117
MABEL CHILTERN,How very selfish of you!,119
MABEL CHILTERN,"You are always telling me of your bad qualities, Lord Goring.",121
MABEL CHILTERN,Are the others very bad?,123
MABEL CHILTERN,"Well, I delight in your bad qualities.  I wouldn’t have you part with one of them.",125
MABEL CHILTERN,"Oh, I think Lady Markby brought her.  Why do you ask?",127
MABEL CHILTERN,What an absurd reason!,129
MABEL CHILTERN,What sort of a woman is she?,131
MABEL CHILTERN,I dislike her already.,133
MABEL CHILTERN,"Delighted, Vicomte, quite delighted!  Aren’t you coming to the music-room?",140
MABEL CHILTERN,The music is in German.  You would not understand it.,142
MABEL CHILTERN,"Why are you talking about Mrs. Cheveley?  Everybody is talking about Mrs. Cheveley!  Lord Goring says—what did you say, Lord Goring, about Mrs. Cheveley?  Oh! I remember, that she was a genius in the daytime and a beauty at night.",178
MABEL CHILTERN,"Is it morbid to have a desire for food?  I have a great desire for food.  Lord Goring, will you give me some supper?",185
MABEL CHILTERN,How horrid you have been!  You have never talked to me the whole evening!,187
MABEL CHILTERN,You might have followed us.  Pursuit would have been only polite.  I don’t think I like you at all this evening!,189
MABEL CHILTERN,"Well, I wish you’d show it in a more marked way!",191
MABEL CHILTERN,What a horrid woman!,290
MABEL CHILTERN,Lord Goring!,292
MABEL CHILTERN,"Lord Goring, you are always ordering me out of the room. I think it most courageous of you.  Especially as I am not going to bed for hours.  You can come and sit down if you like, and talk about anything in the world, except the Royal Academy, Mrs. Cheveley, or novels in Scotch dialect.  They are not improving subjects.  What is this?  Some one has dropped a diamond brooch!  Quite beautiful, isn’t it?  I wish it was mine, but Gertrude won’t let me wear anything but pearls, and I am thoroughly sick of pearls.  They make one look so plain, so good and so intellectual.  I wonder whom the brooch belongs to.",294
MABEL CHILTERN,It is a beautiful brooch.,296
MABEL CHILTERN,It isn’t a bracelet.  It’s a brooch.,298
MABEL CHILTERN,What are you doing?,300
MABEL CHILTERN,"Oh, pray do!  I have been waiting for it all the evening.",302
MABEL CHILTERN,That is a strange request.,304
MABEL CHILTERN,You did?,306
MABEL CHILTERN,"Then I shall certainly bid you good-night.  Good-night, Gertrude!",308
MABEL CHILTERN,"Dear Gertrude, don’t say such a dreadful thing to Lord Goring.  Seriousness would be very unbecoming to him.  Good afternoon Lord Goring!  Pray be as trivial as you can.",508
MABEL CHILTERN,Just when I have come in!  What dreadful manners you have!  I am sure you were very badly brought up.,510
MABEL CHILTERN,I wish I had brought you up!,512
MABEL CHILTERN,"It is too late now, I suppose?",514
MABEL CHILTERN,Will you ride to-morrow morning?,516
MABEL CHILTERN,Don’t forget.,518
MABEL CHILTERN,Tommy is the most useful person in London.,522
MABEL CHILTERN,I don’t want you to have any.  They would not be good for you.,527
MABEL CHILTERN,Sharp.,529
MABEL CHILTERN,Of course I shan’t bring Tommy Trafford.  Tommy Trafford is in great disgrace.,531
MABEL CHILTERN,"Gertrude, I wish you would speak to Tommy Trafford.",533
MABEL CHILTERN,"Well, Tommy has proposed to me again.  Tommy really does nothing but propose to me.  He proposed to me last night in the music-room, when I was quite unprotected, as there was an elaborate trio going on.  I didn’t dare to make the smallest repartee, I need hardly tell you.  If I had, it would have stopped the music at once.  Musical people are so absurdly unreasonable.  They always want one to be perfectly dumb at the very moment when one is longing to be absolutely deaf.  Then he proposed to me in broad daylight this morning, in front of that dreadful statue of Achilles.  Really, the things that go on in front of that work of art are quite appalling.  The police should interfere. At luncheon I saw by the glare in his eye that he was going to propose again, and I just managed to check him in time by assuring him that I was a bimetallist.  Fortunately I don’t know what bimetallism means.  And I don’t believe anybody else does either.  But the observation crushed Tommy for ten minutes.  He looked quite shocked.  And then Tommy is so annoying in the way he proposes.  If he proposed at the top of his voice, I should not mind so much.  That might produce some effect on the public. But he does it in a horrid confidential way.  When Tommy wants to be romantic he talks to one just like a doctor.  I am very fond of Tommy, but his methods of proposing are quite out of date.  I wish, Gertrude, you would speak to him, and tell him that once a week is quite often enough to propose to any one, and that it should always be done in a manner that attracts some attention.",535
MABEL CHILTERN,Oh! I wouldn’t marry a man with a future before him for anything under the sun.,537
MABEL CHILTERN,"I know, dear.  You married a man with a future, didn’t you?  But then Robert was a genius, and you have a noble, self-sacrificing character.  You can stand geniuses.  I have no character at all, and Robert is the only genius I could ever bear.  As a rule, I think they are quite impossible.  Geniuses talk so much, don’t they? Such a bad habit!  And they are always thinking about themselves, when I want them to be thinking about me.  I must go round now and rehearse at Lady Basildon’s.  You remember, we are having tableaux, don’t you?  The Triumph of something, I don’t know what!  I hope it will be triumph of me.  Only triumph I am really interested in at present.  Oh, Gertrude, do you know who is coming to see you?  That dreadful Mrs. Cheveley, in a most lovely gown.  Did you ask her?",539
MABEL CHILTERN,"I assure you she is coming upstairs, as large as life and not nearly so natural.",541
MABEL CHILTERN,Oh! I must shake hands with Lady Markby.  She is delightful.  I love being scolded by her.,543
MABEL CHILTERN,"Really?  I must tell my dressmaker.  It will be such a surprise to her.  Good-bye, Lady Markby!",549
MABEL CHILTERN,I am so sorry but I am obliged to.  I am just off to rehearsal.  I have got to stand on my head in some tableaux.,551
MABEL CHILTERN,"But it is for an excellent charity: in aid of the Undeserving, the only people I am really interested in.  I am the secretary, and Tommy Trafford is treasurer.",553
MABEL CHILTERN,Oh! Lord Goring is president.,555
MABEL CHILTERN,What a dreadful prospect!,558
MABEL CHILTERN,"Thank you so much, Lady Markby, for England . . . and myself.",560
MABEL CHILTERN,"Oh! . . . How do you do, Lord Caversham?  I hope Lady Caversham is quite well?",978
MABEL CHILTERN,And Lady Caversham’s bonnets . . . are they at all better?,981
MABEL CHILTERN,I hope an operation will not be necessary.,984
MABEL CHILTERN,"Oh, are you here?  Of course you understand that after your breaking your appointment I am never going to speak to you again.",987
MABEL CHILTERN,"Lord Goring, I never believe a single word that either you or I say to each other.",989
MABEL CHILTERN,Do you think you could possibly make your son behave a little better occasionally?  Just as a change.,991
MABEL CHILTERN,I am afraid that he has one of those terribly weak natures that are not susceptible to influence.,993
MABEL CHILTERN,"It is very good for you to be in the way, and to know what people say of you behind your back.",996
MABEL CHILTERN,Oh! I hope you are not going to leave me all alone with Lord Goring?  Especially at such an early hour in the day.,999
MABEL CHILTERN,People who don’t keep their appointments in the Park are horrid.,1001
MABEL CHILTERN,I am glad you admit it.  But I wish you wouldn’t look so pleased about it.,1003
MABEL CHILTERN,Then I suppose it is my duty to remain with you?,1005
MABEL CHILTERN,"Well, my duty is a thing I never do, on principle.  It always depresses me.  So I am afraid I must leave you.",1007
MABEL CHILTERN,Oh! is it a proposal?,1009
MABEL CHILTERN,I am so glad.  That makes the second to-day.,1011
MABEL CHILTERN,"Tommy Trafford, of course.  It is one of Tommy’s days for proposing.  He always proposes on Tuesdays and Thursdays, during the Season.",1013
MABEL CHILTERN,"I make it a rule never to accept Tommy.  That is why he goes on proposing.  Of course, as you didn’t turn up this morning, I very nearly said yes.  It would have been an excellent lesson both for him and for you if I had.  It would have taught you both better manners.",1015
MABEL CHILTERN,I know.  And I think you might have mentioned it before. I am sure I have given you heaps of opportunities.,1017
MABEL CHILTERN,Ah! that is the sort of thing a man always says to a girl before he has been married to her.  He never says it afterwards.,1019
MABEL CHILTERN,"You silly Arthur!  If you knew anything about . . . anything, which you don’t, you would know that I adore you.  Every one in London knows it except you.  It is a public scandal the way I adore you. I have been going about for the last six months telling the whole of society that I adore you.  I wonder you consent to have anything to say to me.  I have no character left at all.  At least, I feel so happy that I am quite sure I have no character left at all.",1021
MABEL CHILTERN,"But you never have been refused yet by anybody, have you, Arthur?  I can’t imagine any one refusing you.",1023
MABEL CHILTERN,"I am so glad, darling.  I was afraid you were.",1025
MABEL CHILTERN,"Dear, you look weeks younger than that.",1027
MABEL CHILTERN,"But so am I, Arthur.  So we’re sure to agree.  And now I must go and see Gertrude.",1029
MABEL CHILTERN,Yes.,1031
MABEL CHILTERN,Do you mean to say you didn’t come here expressly to propose to me?,1033
MABEL CHILTERN,Your first.,1035
MABEL CHILTERN,I am delighted to hear it.  Now don’t stir.  I’ll be back in five minutes.  And don’t fall into any temptations while I am away.,1037
MABEL CHILTERN,"How pale you are looking, Gertrude!  It is most becoming!",1040
MABEL CHILTERN,I shall be in the conservatory under the second palm tree on the left.,1043
MABEL CHILTERN,Yes; the usual palm tree.,1045
MABEL CHILTERN,"Lord Goring, I think your father’s conversation much more improving than yours.  I am only going to talk to Lord Caversham in the future, and always under the usual palm tree.",1181
MABEL CHILTERN,"You’ll stop to luncheon, Lord Caversham, won’t you?",1187
MABEL CHILTERN,"An ideal husband!  Oh, I don’t think I should like that. It sounds like something in the next world.",1191
MABEL CHILTERN,He can be what he chooses.  All I want is to be . . . to be . . . oh! a real wife to him.,1193
LADY MARKBY,"Good evening, dear Gertrude!  So kind of you to let me bring my friend, Mrs. Cheveley.  Two such charming women should know each other!",33
LADY MARKBY,"Ah, nowadays people marry as often as they can, don’t they?  It is most fashionable. Dear Duchess, and how is the Duke?  Brain still weak, I suppose?  Well, that is only to be expected, is it not?  His good father was just the same.  There is nothing like race, is there?",35
LADY MARKBY,"Oh! I have brought a much more charming person than Sir John.  Sir John’s temper since he has taken seriously to politics has become quite unbearable.  Really, now that the House of Commons is trying to become useful, it does a great deal of harm.",50
LADY MARKBY,"Her name is Mrs. Cheveley!  One of the Dorsetshire Cheveleys, I suppose.  But I really don’t know.  Families are so mixed nowadays.  Indeed, as a rule, everybody turns out to be somebody else.",52
LADY MARKBY,She has just arrived from Vienna.,54
LADY MARKBY,"Oh! she goes everywhere there, and has such pleasant scandals about all her friends.  I really must go to Vienna next winter. I hope there is a good chef at the Embassy.",56
LADY MARKBY,"Let me introduce you.  My dear, Sir Robert Chiltern is dying to know you!",58
LADY MARKBY,"Well, dear Mrs. Cheveley, I hope you have enjoyed yourself. Sir Robert is very entertaining, is he not?",272
LADY MARKBY,"He has had a very interesting and brilliant career.  And he has married a most admirable wife.  Lady Chiltern is a woman of the very highest principles, I am glad to say.  I am a little too old now, myself, to trouble about setting a good example, but I always admire people who do.  And Lady Chiltern has a very ennobling effect on life, though her dinner-parties are rather dull sometimes.  But one can’t have everything, can one?  And now I must go, dear.  Shall I call for you to-morrow?",274
LADY MARKBY,We might drive in the Park at five.  Everything looks so fresh in the Park now!,276
LADY MARKBY,"Perhaps the people are a little jaded.  I have often observed that the Season as it goes on produces a kind of softening of the brain.  However, I think anything is better than high intellectual pressure.  That is the most unbecoming thing there is.  It makes the noses of the young girls so particularly large.  And there is nothing so difficult to marry as a large nose; men don’t like them.  Good-night, dear!  Good-night, Gertrude!",278
LADY MARKBY,Going already?,550
LADY MARKBY,"On your head, child?  Oh! I hope not.  I believe it is most unhealthy.",552
LADY MARKBY,"You are remarkably modern, Mabel.  A little too modern, perhaps.  Nothing is so dangerous as being too modern. One is apt to grow old-fashioned quite suddenly.  I have known many instances of it.",557
LADY MARKBY,"Ah! my dear, you need not be nervous.  You will always be as pretty as possible.  That is the best fashion there is, and the only fashion that England succeeds in setting.",559
LADY MARKBY,"Dear Gertrude, we just called to know if Mrs. Cheveley’s diamond brooch has been found.",561
LADY MARKBY,"Ah yes, I suppose it must have been at the Opera.  The fact is, we all scramble and jostle so much nowadays that I wonder we have anything at all left on us at the end of an evening.  I know myself that, when I am coming back from the Drawing Room, I always feel as if I hadn’t a shred on me, except a small shred of decent reputation, just enough to prevent the lower classes making painful observations through the windows of the carriage.  The fact is that our Society is terribly over-populated.  Really, some one should arrange a proper scheme of assisted emigration.  It would do a great deal of good.",566
LADY MARKBY,"That is quite true, dear.  But one needn’t know them.  I’m sure I don’t know half the people who come to my house.  Indeed, from all I hear, I shouldn’t like to.",568
LADY MARKBY,"I thought you said there was a sapphire on the head, dear?",571
LADY MARKBY,"And very becoming, I am quite sure.",573
LADY MARKBY,"Well, I must say it is most annoying to lose anything.  I remember once at Bath, years ago, losing in the Pump Room an exceedingly handsome cameo bracelet that Sir John had given me.  I don’t think he has ever given me anything since, I am sorry to say.  He has sadly degenerated.  Really, this horrid House of Commons quite ruins our husbands for us.  I think the Lower House by far the greatest blow to a happy married life that there has been since that terrible thing called the Higher Education of Women was invented.",578
LADY MARKBY,"They do, dear.  But I am afraid such a scheme would be quite unpractical.  I don’t think man has much capacity for development. He has got as far as he can, and that is not far, is it?  With regard to women, well, dear Gertrude, you belong to the younger generation, and I am sure it is all right if you approve of it.  In my time, of course, we were taught not to understand anything.  That was the old system, and wonderfully interesting it was.  I assure you that the amount of things I and my poor dear sister were taught not to understand was quite extraordinary.  But modern women understand everything, I am told.",581
LADY MARKBY,"And a very good thing too, dear, I dare say.  It might break up many a happy home if they did.  Not yours, I need hardly say, Gertrude.  You have married a pattern husband.  I wish I could say as much for myself.  But since Sir John has taken to attending the debates regularly, which he never used to do in the good old days, his language has become quite impossible.  He always seems to think that he is addressing the House, and consequently whenever he discusses the state of the agricultural labourer, or the Welsh Church, or something quite improper of that kind, I am obliged to send all the servants out of the room.  It is not pleasant to see one’s own butler, who has been with one for twenty-three years, actually blushing at the side-board, and the footmen making contortions in corners like persons in circuses.  I assure you my life will be quite ruined unless they send John at once to the Upper House.  He won’t take any interest in politics then, will he?  The House of Lords is so sensible.  An assembly of gentlemen.  But in his present state, Sir John is really a great trial.  Why, this morning before breakfast was half over, he stood up on the hearthrug, put his hands in his pockets, and appealed to the country at the top of his voice.  I left the table as soon as I had my second cup of tea, I need hardly say.  But his violent language could be heard all over the house! I trust, Gertrude, that Sir Robert is not like that?",583
LADY MARKBY,"Well, I hope he is not as devoted to Blue Books as Sir John is.  I don’t think they can be quite improving reading for any one.",585
LADY MARKBY,"Yellow is a gayer colour, is it not?  I used to wear yellow a good deal in my early days, and would do so now if Sir John was not so painfully personal in his observations, and a man on the question of dress is always ridiculous, is he not?",587
LADY MARKBY,Really?  One wouldn’t say so from the sort of hats they wear? would one?,589
LADY MARKBY,"No thanks, dear.  The fact is, I have promised to go round for ten minutes to see poor Lady Brancaster, who is in very great trouble.  Her daughter, quite a well-brought-up girl, too, has actually become engaged to be married to a curate in Shropshire.  It is very sad, very sad indeed.  I can’t understand this modern mania for curates.  In my time we girls saw them, of course, running about the place like rabbits.  But we never took any notice of them, I need hardly say.  But I am told that nowadays country society is quite honeycombed with them.  I think it most irreligious.  And then the eldest son has quarrelled with his father, and it is said that when they meet at the club Lord Brancaster always hides himself behind the money article in _The Times_.  However, I believe that is quite a common occurrence nowadays and that they have to take in extra copies of _The Times_ at all the clubs in St. James’s Street; there are so many sons who won’t have anything to do with their fathers, and so many fathers who won’t speak to their sons.  I think myself, it is very much to be regretted.",593
LADY MARKBY,"Really, dear?  What?",595
LADY MARKBY,"Ah!  I am afraid Lord Brancaster knew a good deal about that.  More than his poor wife ever did. You know Lady Brancaster, don’t you, dear?",597
LADY MARKBY,"Well, like all stout women, she looks the very picture of happiness, as no doubt you noticed.  But there are many tragedies in her family, besides this affair of the curate.  Her own sister, Mrs. Jekyll, had a most unhappy life; through no fault of her own, I am sorry to say. She ultimately was so broken-hearted that she went into a convent, or on to the operatic stage, I forget which.  No; I think it was decorative art-needlework she took up.  I know she had lost all sense of pleasure in life.  And now, Gertrude, if you will allow me, I shall leave Mrs. Cheveley in your charge and call back for her in a quarter of an hour.  Or perhaps, dear Mrs. Cheveley, you wouldn’t mind waiting in the carriage while I am with Lady Brancaster.  As I intend it to be a visit of condolence, I shan’t stay long.",599
LADY MARKBY,"Well, I hear the curate is always prowling about the house.",601
LADY MARKBY,"Ah! no doubt you both have many pleasant reminiscences of your schooldays to talk over together.  Good-bye, dear Gertrude!  Shall I see you at Lady Bonar’s to-night?  She has discovered a wonderful new genius.  He does . . . nothing at all, I believe.  That is a great comfort, is it not?",604
LADY MARKBY,"Dining at home by yourselves?  Is that quite prudent?  Ah, I forgot, your husband is an exception.  Mine is the general rule, and nothing ages a woman so rapidly as having married the general rule.",606
MRS. CHEVELEY,"But have we really met before, Lady Chiltern?  I can’t remember where.  I have been out of England for so long.",36
MRS. CHEVELEY,"Do you know, I am quite looking forward to meeting your clever husband, Lady Chiltern.  Since he has been at the Foreign Office, he has been so much talked of in Vienna. They actually succeed in spelling his name right in the newspapers.  That in itself is fame, on the continent.",40
MRS. CHEVELEY,"Not since Berlin, Vicomte.  Five years ago!",43
MRS. CHEVELEY,By making it a rule only to talk to perfectly charming people like yourself.,45
MRS. CHEVELEY,Do they say that here?  How dreadful of them!,47
MRS. CHEVELEY,"Thank you, Sir Robert.  An acquaintance that begins with a compliment is sure to develop into a real friendship.  It starts in the right manner.  And I find that I know Lady Chiltern already.",60
MRS. CHEVELEY,Yes.  She has just reminded me that we were at school together.  I remember it perfectly now.  She always got the good conduct prize.  I have a distinct recollection of Lady Chiltern always getting the good conduct prize!,62
MRS. CHEVELEY,My prizes came a little later on in life.  I don’t think any of them were for good conduct.  I forget!,64
MRS. CHEVELEY,"I don’t know that women are always rewarded for being charming.  I think they are usually punished for it!  Certainly, more women grow old nowadays through the faithfulness of their admirers than through anything else!  At least that is the only way I can account for the terribly haggard look of most of your pretty women in London!",66
MRS. CHEVELEY,"Oh, I’m neither.  Optimism begins in a broad grin, and Pessimism ends with blue spectacles.  Besides, they are both of them merely poses.",68
MRS. CHEVELEY,Sometimes.  But it is such a very difficult pose to keep up.,70
MRS. CHEVELEY,"Ah! the strength of women comes from the fact that psychology cannot explain us.  Men can be analysed, women . . . merely adored.",72
MRS. CHEVELEY,"Science can never grapple with the irrational.  That is why it has no future before it, in this world.",74
MRS. CHEVELEY,Well-dressed women do.,76
MRS. CHEVELEY,Questions are never indiscreet.  Answers sometimes are.,78
MRS. CHEVELEY,"Politics are my only pleasure.  You see nowadays it is not fashionable to flirt till one is forty, or to be romantic till one is forty-five, so we poor women who are under thirty, or say we are, have nothing open to us but politics or philanthropy.  And philanthropy seems to me to have become simply the refuge of people who wish to annoy their fellow-creatures.  I prefer politics.  I think they are more . . . becoming!",80
MRS. CHEVELEY,"Sometimes.  And sometimes it is a clever game, Sir Robert.  And sometimes it is a great nuisance.",82
MRS. CHEVELEY,I?  A combination of all three.,84
MRS. CHEVELEY,Thanks.,86
MRS. CHEVELEY,"Oh! I don’t care about the London season!  It is too matrimonial.  People are either hunting for husbands, or hiding from them.  I wanted to meet you.  It is quite true.  You know what a woman’s curiosity is.  Almost as great as a man’s!  I wanted immensely to meet you, and . . . to ask you to do something for me.",88
MRS. CHEVELEY,"No, I don’t think it is quite a little thing.",90
MRS. CHEVELEY,Later on.  And now may I walk through your beautiful house?  I hear your pictures are charming.  Poor Baron Arnheim—you remember the Baron?—used to tell me you had some wonderful Corots.,92
MRS. CHEVELEY,Intimately.  Did you?,94
MRS. CHEVELEY,"Wonderful man, wasn’t he?",96
MRS. CHEVELEY,I often think it such a pity he never wrote his memoirs. They would have been most interesting.,98
MRS. CHEVELEY,Without the dreadful disadvantage of having a Penelope waiting at home for him.,100
MRS. CHEVELEY,I have met Lord Goring before.,103
MRS. CHEVELEY,My memory is under admirable control.  And are you still a bachelor?,105
MRS. CHEVELEY,How very romantic!,107
MRS. CHEVELEY,He reflects every credit on the institution.,110
MRS. CHEVELEY,"That depends partly on the weather, partly on the cooking, and partly on Sir Robert.",112
MRS. CHEVELEY,"There is no danger, at present!",114
MRS. CHEVELEY,"Oh, no!  I can’t stand your English house-parties.  In England people actually try to be brilliant at breakfast.  That is so dreadful of them!  Only dull people are brilliant at breakfast.  And then the family skeleton is always reading family prayers.  My stay in England really depends on you, Sir Robert.",207
MRS. CHEVELEY,"Quite seriously.  I want to talk to you about a great political and financial scheme, about this Argentine Canal Company, in fact.",209
MRS. CHEVELEY,"Oh, I like tedious, practical subjects.  What I don’t like are tedious, practical people.  There is a wide difference. Besides, you are interested, I know, in International Canal schemes.  You were Lord Radley’s secretary, weren’t you, when the Government bought the Suez Canal shares?",211
MRS. CHEVELEY,"A speculation, Sir Robert!  A brilliant, daring speculation.",213
MRS. CHEVELEY,I have invested very largely in it.,215
MRS. CHEVELEY,Your old friend—and mine.,217
MRS. CHEVELEY,Baron Arnheim.,219
MRS. CHEVELEY,"It was his last romance.  His last but one, to do him justice.",221
MRS. CHEVELEY,"I am not in a mood to-night for silver twilights, or rose-pink dawns.  I want to talk business.",223
MRS. CHEVELEY,"That you must not do.  In your own interests, Sir Robert, to say nothing of mine, you must not do that.",225
MRS. CHEVELEY,"Sir Robert, I will be quite frank with you.  I want you to withdraw the report that you had intended to lay before the House, on the ground that you have reasons to believe that the Commissioners have been prejudiced or misinformed, or something.  Then I want you to say a few words to the effect that the Government is going to reconsider the question, and that you have reason to believe that the Canal, if completed, will be of great international value.  You know the sort of things ministers say in cases of this kind.  A few ordinary platitudes will do.  In modern life nothing produces such an effect as a good platitude.  It makes the whole world kin.  Will you do that for me?",227
MRS. CHEVELEY,I am quite serious.,229
MRS. CHEVELEY,"Ah! but I am.  And if you do what I ask you, I . . . will pay you very handsomely!",231
MRS. CHEVELEY,Yes.,233
MRS. CHEVELEY,How very disappointing!  And I have come all the way from Vienna in order that you should thoroughly understand me.,235
MRS. CHEVELEY,"My dear Sir Robert, you are a man of the world, and you have your price, I suppose. Everybody has nowadays.  The drawback is that most people are so dreadfully expensive.  I know I am.  I hope you will be more reasonable in your terms.",237
MRS. CHEVELEY,I realise that I am talking to a man who laid the foundation of his fortune by selling to a Stock Exchange speculator a Cabinet secret.,239
MRS. CHEVELEY,"I mean that I know the real origin of your wealth and your career, and I have got your letter, too.",241
MRS. CHEVELEY,"The letter you wrote to Baron Arnheim, when you were Lord Radley’s secretary, telling the Baron to buy Suez Canal shares—a letter written three days before the Government announced its own purchase.",243
MRS. CHEVELEY,You thought that letter had been destroyed.  How foolish of you!  It is in my possession.,245
MRS. CHEVELEY,"It was a swindle, Sir Robert.  Let us call things by their proper names.  It makes everything simpler.  And now I am going to sell you that letter, and the price I ask for it is your public support of the Argentine scheme.  You made your own fortune out of one canal. You must help me and my friends to make our fortunes out of another!",247
MRS. CHEVELEY,"Oh, no!  This is the game of life as we all have to play it, Sir Robert, sooner or later!",249
MRS. CHEVELEY,You mean you cannot help doing it.  You know you are standing on the edge of a precipice.  And it is not for you to make terms.  It is for you to accept them.  Supposing you refuse—,251
MRS. CHEVELEY,"My dear Sir Robert, what then?  You are ruined, that is all!  Remember to what a point your Puritanism in England has brought you.  In old days nobody pretended to be a bit better than his neighbours.  In fact, to be a bit better than one’s neighbour was considered excessively vulgar and middle-class.  Nowadays, with our modern mania for morality, every one has to pose as a paragon of purity, incorruptibility, and all the other seven deadly virtues—and what is the result?  You all go over like ninepins—one after the other.  Not a year passes in England without somebody disappearing.  Scandals used to lend charm, or at least interest, to a man—now they crush him.  And yours is a very nasty scandal. You couldn’t survive it.  If it were known that as a young man, secretary to a great and important minister, you sold a Cabinet secret for a large sum of money, and that that was the origin of your wealth and career, you would be hounded out of public life, you would disappear completely.  And after all, Sir Robert, why should you sacrifice your entire future rather than deal diplomatically with your enemy?  For the moment I am your enemy.  I admit it!  And I am much stronger than you are.  The big battalions are on my side.  You have a splendid position, but it is your splendid position that makes you so vulnerable.  You can’t defend it!  And I am in attack.  Of course I have not talked morality to you.  You must admit in fairness that I have spared you that.  Years ago you did a clever, unscrupulous thing; it turned out a great success.  You owe to it your fortune and position. And now you have got to pay for it.  Sooner or later we have all to pay for what we do.  You have to pay now.  Before I leave you to-night, you have got to promise me to suppress your report, and to speak in the House in favour of this scheme.",253
MRS. CHEVELEY,"You must make it possible.  You are going to make it possible.  Sir Robert, you know what your English newspapers are like. Suppose that when I leave this house I drive down to some newspaper office, and give them this scandal and the proofs of it!  Think of their loathsome joy, of the delight they would have in dragging you down, of the mud and mire they would plunge you in.  Think of the hypocrite with his greasy smile penning his leading article, and arranging the foulness of the public placard.",255
MRS. CHEVELEY,Those are my terms.,257
MRS. CHEVELEY,"Even you are not rich enough, Sir Robert, to buy back your past.  No man is.",259
MRS. CHEVELEY,You have to.  If you don’t . . .,261
MRS. CHEVELEY,"Yes.  That is agreed.  I will be in the Ladies’ Gallery to-morrow night at half-past eleven.  If by that time—and you will have had heaps of opportunity—you have made an announcement to the House in the terms I wish, I shall hand you back your letter with the prettiest thanks, and the best, or at any rate the most suitable, compliment I can think of.  I intend to play quite fairly with you.  One should always play fairly . . . when one has the winning cards.  The Baron taught me that . . . amongst other things.",263
MRS. CHEVELEY,No; you must settle now!,265
MRS. CHEVELEY,Impossible!  I have got to telegraph to Vienna to-night.,267
MRS. CHEVELEY,Circumstances.,269
MRS. CHEVELEY,"Thank you.  I knew we should come to an amicable agreement.  I understood your nature from the first.  I analysed you, though you did not adore me.  And now you can get my carriage for me, Sir Robert.  I see the people coming up from supper, and Englishmen always get romantic after a meal, and that bores me dreadfully.",271
MRS. CHEVELEY,Most entertaining!  I have enjoyed my talk with him immensely.,273
MRS. CHEVELEY,Thanks.,275
MRS. CHEVELEY,Except the people!,277
MRS. CHEVELEY,"What a charming house you have, Lady Chiltern!  I have spent a delightful evening.  It has been so interesting getting to know your husband.",279
MRS. CHEVELEY,"Oh, I will tell you.  I wanted to interest him in this Argentine Canal scheme, of which I dare say you have heard.  And I found him most susceptible,—susceptible to reason, I mean.  A rare thing in a man.  I converted him in ten minutes.  He is going to make a speech in the House to-morrow night in favour of the idea.  We must go to the Ladies’ Gallery and hear him!  It will be a great occasion!",281
MRS. CHEVELEY,"Oh, I assure you it’s all settled.  I don’t regret my tedious journey from Vienna now.  It has been a great success.  But, of course, for the next twenty-four hours the whole thing is a dead secret.",283
MRS. CHEVELEY,Between your husband and myself.,285
MRS. CHEVELEY,"Thanks!  Good evening, Lady Chiltern!  Good-night, Lord Goring!  I am at Claridge’s.  Don’t you think you might leave a card?",287
MRS. CHEVELEY,"Oh, don’t be so solemn about it, or I shall be obliged to leave a card on you.  In England I suppose that would hardly be considered _en règle_.  Abroad, we are more civilised.  Will you see me down, Sir Robert?  Now that we have both the same interests at heart we shall be great friends, I hope!",289
MRS. CHEVELEY,Thanks.  Isn’t that Miss Chiltern?  I should like so much to know her.,546
MRS. CHEVELEY,And what is Lord Goring?,554
MRS. CHEVELEY,"The post should suit him admirably, unless he has deteriorated since I knew him first.",556
MRS. CHEVELEY,"Yes.  I missed it when I got back to Claridge’s, and I thought I might possibly have dropped it here.",563
MRS. CHEVELEY,"Oh, pray don’t trouble, Lady Chiltern.  I dare say I lost it at the Opera, before we came on here.",565
MRS. CHEVELEY,"I quite agree with you, Lady Markby.  It is nearly six years since I have been in London for the Season, and I must say Society has become dreadfully mixed.  One sees the oddest people everywhere.",567
MRS. CHEVELEY,"A diamond snake-brooch with a ruby, a rather large ruby.",570
MRS. CHEVELEY,"It really is of no consequence, Lady Chiltern.  I am so sorry to have put you to any inconvenience.",576
MRS. CHEVELEY,The higher education of men is what I should like to see. Men need it so sadly.,580
MRS. CHEVELEY,Except their husbands.  That is the one thing the modern woman never understands.,582
MRS. CHEVELEY,"Oh, no!  I think men are the only authorities on dress.",588
MRS. CHEVELEY,Thanks.,591
MRS. CHEVELEY,So do I.  Fathers have so much to learn from their sons nowadays.,594
MRS. CHEVELEY,The art of living.  The only really Fine Art we have produced in modern times.,596
MRS. CHEVELEY,I am afraid I am not fond of girl friends.,602
MRS. CHEVELEY,"How very kind of you, Lady Chiltern!  Believe me, nothing would give me greater pleasure.",603
MRS. CHEVELEY,"Wonderful woman, Lady Markby, isn’t she?  Talks more and says less than anybody I ever met.  She is made to be a public speaker. Much more so than her husband, though he is a typical Englishman, always dull and usually violent.",607
MRS. CHEVELEY,"I see that after all these years you have not changed a bit, Gertrude.",611
MRS. CHEVELEY,Would you apply that rule to every one?,615
MRS. CHEVELEY,"Then I am sorry for you, Gertrude, very sorry for you.",617
MRS. CHEVELEY,It was you who made him write that insolent letter to me?  It was you who made him break his promise?,621
MRS. CHEVELEY,Then you must make him keep it.  I give you till to-morrow morning—no more.  If by that time your husband does not solemnly bind himself to help me in this great scheme in which I am interested—,623
MRS. CHEVELEY,"Call it what you choose.  I hold your husband in the hollow of my hand, and if you are wise you will make him do what I tell him.",625
MRS. CHEVELEY,"Your house!  A house bought with the price of dishonour. A house, everything in which has been paid for by fraud.  Ask him what the origin of his fortune is!  Get him to tell you how he sold to a stockbroker a Cabinet secret. Learn from him to what you owe your position.",629
MRS. CHEVELEY,Look at him!  Can he deny it?  Does he dare to?,631
MRS. CHEVELEY,"My worst?  I have not yet finished with you, with either of you.  I give you both till to-morrow at noon.  If by then you don’t do what I bid you to do, the whole world shall know the origin of Robert Chiltern.",633
MRS. CHEVELEY,Is Lord Goring not here?  I was told he was at home?,723
MRS. CHEVELEY,How very filial!,725
MRS. CHEVELEY,Lord Goring expects me?,727
MRS. CHEVELEY,Are you quite sure?,729
MRS. CHEVELEY,"How thoughtful of him!  To expect the unexpected shows a thoroughly modern intellect.  Ugh!  How dreary a bachelor’s drawing-room always looks.  I shall have to alter all this.  No, I don’t care for that lamp.  It is far too glaring.  Light some candles.",731
MRS. CHEVELEY,I hope the candles have very becoming shades.,733
MRS. CHEVELEY,"I wonder what woman he is waiting for to-night.  It will be delightful to catch him.  Men always look so silly when they are caught.  And they are always being caught.  What a very interesting room! What a very interesting picture!  Wonder what his correspondence is like. Oh, what a very uninteresting correspondence! Bills and cards, debts and dowagers!  Who on earth writes to him on pink paper?  How silly to write on pink paper!  It looks like the beginning of a middle-class romance.  Romance should never begin with sentiment.  It should begin with science and end with a settlement.  I know that handwriting.  That is Gertrude Chiltern’s.  I remember it perfectly.  The ten commandments in every stroke of the pen, and the moral law all over the page.  Wonder what Gertrude is writing to him about?  Something horrid about me, I suppose.  How I detest that woman!  ‘I trust you.  I want you.  I am coming to you.  Gertrude.’  ‘I trust you.  I want you.  I am coming to you.’",735
MRS. CHEVELEY,Thank you.,737
MRS. CHEVELEY,Then I am sure they will be perfectly right.,739
MRS. CHEVELEY,"Good evening, Lord Goring!",819
MRS. CHEVELEY,Merely listening.  I have a perfect passion for listening through keyholes.  One always hears such wonderful things through them.,821
MRS. CHEVELEY,Oh! surely Providence can resist temptation by this time.,823
MRS. CHEVELEY,Oh! pray don’t.  One should never give a woman anything that she can’t wear in the evening.,825
MRS. CHEVELEY,Far more!  I have greatly improved.  I have had more experience.,827
MRS. CHEVELEY,"Thanks.  I never smoke.  My dressmaker wouldn’t like it, and a woman’s first duty in life is to her dressmaker, isn’t it?  What the second duty is, no one has as yet discovered.",829
MRS. CHEVELEY,To offer it to you on conditions.  How did you guess that?,831
MRS. CHEVELEY,"Oh, no!  A well-made dress has no pockets.",833
MRS. CHEVELEY,"How absurdly English you are!  The English think that a cheque-book can solve every problem in life.  Why, my dear Arthur, I have very much more money than you have, and quite as much as Robert Chiltern has got hold of.  Money is not what I want.",835
MRS. CHEVELEY,Why don’t you call me Laura?,837
MRS. CHEVELEY,You used to adore it.,839
MRS. CHEVELEY,"Arthur, you loved me once.",841
MRS. CHEVELEY,And you asked me to be your wife.,843
MRS. CHEVELEY,"And you threw me over because you saw, or said you saw, poor old Lord Mortlake trying to have a violent flirtation with me in the conservatory at Tenby.",845
MRS. CHEVELEY,At that time I was poor; you were rich.,847
MRS. CHEVELEY,"Poor old Lord Mortlake, who had only two topics of conversation, his gout and his wife!  I never could quite make out which of the two he was talking about.  He used the most horrible language about them both.  Well, you were silly, Arthur. Why, Lord Mortlake was never anything more to me than an amusement.  One of those utterly tedious amusements one only finds at an English country house on an English country Sunday.  I don’t think any one at all morally responsible for what he or she does at an English country house.",849
MRS. CHEVELEY,"I loved you, Arthur.",851
MRS. CHEVELEY,"I did love you.  And you loved me.  You know you loved me; and love is a very wonderful thing.  I suppose that when a man has once loved a woman, he will do anything for her, except continue to love her?",853
MRS. CHEVELEY,"I am tired of living abroad.  I want to come back to London.  I want to have a charming house here.  I want to have a salon.  If one could only teach the English how to talk, and the Irish how to listen, society here would be quite civilised.  Besides, I have arrived at the romantic stage.  When I saw you last night at the Chilterns’, I knew you were the only person I had ever cared for, if I ever have cared for anybody, Arthur.  And so, on the morning of the day you marry me, I will give you Robert Chiltern’s letter.  That is my offer.  I will give it to you now, if you promise to marry me.",855
MRS. CHEVELEY,To-morrow.,857
MRS. CHEVELEY,"Yes, quite serious.",859
MRS. CHEVELEY,I don’t mind bad husbands.  I have had two.  They amused me immensely.,861
MRS. CHEVELEY,What do you know about my married life?,863
MRS. CHEVELEY,What book?,865
MRS. CHEVELEY,Do you think it is quite charming of you to be so rude to a woman in your own house?,867
MRS. CHEVELEY,"I suppose that is meant for a compliment.  My dear Arthur, women are never disarmed by compliments.  Men always are.  That is the difference between the two sexes.",869
MRS. CHEVELEY,"Then you are going to allow your greatest friend, Robert Chiltern, to be ruined, rather than marry some one who really has considerable attractions left.  I thought you would have risen to some great height of self-sacrifice, Arthur.  I think you should.  And the rest of your life you could spend in contemplating your own perfections.",871
MRS. CHEVELEY,As if anything could demoralise Robert Chiltern!  You seem to forget that I know his real character.,873
MRS. CHEVELEY,How you men stand up for each other!,875
MRS. CHEVELEY,"I only war against one woman, against Gertrude Chiltern.  I hate her.  I hate her now more than ever.",877
MRS. CHEVELEY,"Oh, there is only one real tragedy in a woman’s life.  The fact that her past is always her lover, and her future invariably her husband.",879
MRS. CHEVELEY,"A woman whose size in gloves is seven and three-quarters never knows much about anything.  You know Gertrude has always worn seven and three-quarters?  That is one of the reasons why there was never any moral sympathy between us. . . . Well, Arthur, I suppose this romantic interview may be regarded as at an end.  You admit it was romantic, don’t you?  For the privilege of being your wife I was ready to surrender a great prize, the climax of my diplomatic career.  You decline.  Very well.  If Sir Robert doesn’t uphold my Argentine scheme, I expose him. _Voilà tout_.",881
MRS. CHEVELEY,"Oh! don’t use big words. They mean so little.  It is a commercial transaction.  That is all. There is no good mixing up sentimentality in it.  I offered to sell Robert Chiltern a certain thing.  If he won’t pay me my price, he will have to pay the world a greater price.  There is no more to be said.  I must go.  Good-bye.  Won’t you shake hands?",883
MRS. CHEVELEY,"Arthur, you are unjust to me.  Believe me, you are quite unjust to me.  I didn’t go to taunt Gertrude at all.  I had no idea of doing anything of the kind when I entered.  I called with Lady Markby simply to ask whether an ornament, a jewel, that I lost somewhere last night, had been found at the Chilterns’.  If you don’t believe me, you can ask Lady Markby.  She will tell you it is true.  The scene that occurred happened after Lady Markby had left, and was really forced on me by Gertrude’s rudeness and sneers.  I called, oh!—a little out of malice if you like—but really to ask if a diamond brooch of mine had been found. That was the origin of the whole thing.",885
MRS. CHEVELEY,Yes.  How do you know?,887
MRS. CHEVELEY,Yes.  I am so glad to get it back.  It was . . a present.,889
MRS. CHEVELEY,"Certainly, if you pin it in.  Why do you put it on as a bracelet?  I never knew it could be worn as a bracelet.",891
MRS. CHEVELEY,"No; but it looks very well on me as a bracelet, doesn’t it?",893
MRS. CHEVELEY,When did you see it last?,895
MRS. CHEVELEY,What do you mean?,897
MRS. CHEVELEY,It is not true.,899
MRS. CHEVELEY,"I will deny the whole affair from beginning to end.  I will say that I have never seen this wretched thing, that it was never in my possession.",901
MRS. CHEVELEY,You brute!  You coward!,903
MRS. CHEVELEY,What are you going to do?,905
MRS. CHEVELEY,The police?  What for?,907
MRS. CHEVELEY,Don’t do that.  I will do anything you want.  Anything in the world you want.,909
MRS. CHEVELEY,Stop! Stop!  Let me have time to think.,911
MRS. CHEVELEY,I have not got it with me.  I will give it to you to-morrow.,913
MRS. CHEVELEY,Yes.,915
MRS. CHEVELEY,Please get me a glass of water.,917
MRS. CHEVELEY,Thank you.  Will you help me on with my cloak?,919
MRS. CHEVELEY,Thanks.  I am never going to try to harm Robert Chiltern again.,921
MRS. CHEVELEY,"Well, if even I had the chance, I wouldn’t.  On the contrary, I am going to render him a great service.",923
MRS. CHEVELEY,"Yes.  I can’t bear so upright a gentleman, so honourable an English gentleman, being so shamefully deceived, and so—",925
MRS. CHEVELEY,I find that somehow Gertrude Chiltern’s dying speech and confession has strayed into my pocket.,927
MRS. CHEVELEY,I mean that I am going to send Robert Chiltern the love-letter his wife wrote to you to-night.,929
MRS. CHEVELEY,‘I want you.  I trust you.  I am coming to you.  Gertrude.’,931
MRS. CHEVELEY,"Lord Goring merely rang that you should show me out.  Good-night, Lord Goring!",933
VICOMTE DE NANJAC,"Ah! chère Madame, quelle surprise!  I have not seen you since Berlin!",42
VICOMTE DE NANJAC,And you are younger and more beautiful than ever. How do you manage it?,44
VICOMTE DE NANJAC,"Ah! you flatter me.  You butter me, as they say here.",46
VICOMTE DE NANJAC,"Yes, they have a wonderful language.  It should be more widely known.",48
VICOMTE DE NANJAC,"Ah, the English young lady is the dragon of good taste, is she not?  Quite the dragon of good taste.",135
VICOMTE DE NANJAC,I read all your English newspapers.  I find them so amusing.,137
VICOMTE DE NANJAC,"I should like to, but my professor objects.  May I have the pleasure of escorting you to the music-room, Mademoiselle?",139
VICOMTE DE NANJAC,"May I have the honour of taking you down to supper, Comtesse?",196
VICOMTE DE NANJAC,I am so fond of eating!  I am very English in all my tastes.,198
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"Good evening, Lady Markby!  I hope you have brought Sir John with you?",49
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"I hope not, Lady Markby.  At any rate we do our best to waste the public time, don’t we?  But who is this charming person you have been kind enough to bring to us?",51
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Mrs. Cheveley?  I seem to know the name.,53
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Ah! yes.  I think I know whom you mean.,55
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"If there is not, the Ambassador will certainly have to be recalled.  Pray point out Mrs. Cheveley to me.  I should like to see her.",57
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Every one is dying to know the brilliant Mrs. Cheveley.  Our attachés at Vienna write to us about nothing else.,59
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Really?,61
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"And what prizes did you get, Mrs. Cheveley?",63
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,I am sure they were for something charming!,65
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"What an appalling philosophy that sounds!  To attempt to classify you, Mrs. Cheveley, would be an impertinence.  But may I ask, at heart, are you an optimist or a pessimist?  Those seem to be the only two fashionable religions left to us nowadays.",67
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,You prefer to be natural?,69
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"What would those modern psychological novelists, of whom we hear so much, say to such a theory as that?",71
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,You think science cannot grapple with the problem of women?,73
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,And women represent the irrational.,75
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"I fear I could hardly agree with you there.  But do sit down.  And now tell me, what makes you leave your brilliant Vienna for our gloomy London—or perhaps the question is indiscreet?",77
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"Well, at any rate, may I know if it is politics or pleasure?",79
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,A political life is a noble career!,81
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Which do you find it?,83
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Allow me!,85
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,But you have not told me yet what makes you honour London so suddenly.  Our season is almost over.,87
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"I hope it is not a little thing, Mrs. Cheveley.  I find that little things are so very difficult to do.",89
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,I am so glad.  Do tell me what it is.,91
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Did you know Baron Arnheim well?,93
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,At one time.,95
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"He was very remarkable, in many ways.",97
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"Yes: he knew men and cities well, like the old Greek.",99
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"Good evening, my dear Arthur!  Mrs. Cheveley, allow me to introduce to you Lord Goring, the idlest man in London.",102
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"Lord Goring is the result of Boodle’s Club, Mrs. Cheveley.",109
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"You are not going to plunge us into a European war, I hope?",113
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"And are you going to any of our country houses before you leave England, Mrs. Cheveley?",206
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Seriously?,208
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"What a tedious, practical subject for you to talk about, Mrs. Cheveley!",210
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Yes.  But the Suez Canal was a very great and splendid undertaking.  It gave us our direct route to India.  It had imperial value.  It was necessary that we should have control.  This Argentine scheme is a commonplace Stock Exchange swindle.,212
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"Believe me, Mrs. Cheveley, it is a swindle.  Let us call things by their proper names.  It makes matters simpler.  We have all the information about it at the Foreign Office.  In fact, I sent out a special Commission to inquire into the matter privately, and they report that the works are hardly begun, and as for the money already subscribed, no one seems to know what has become of it.  The whole thing is a second Panama, and with not a quarter of the chance of success that miserable affair ever had.  I hope you have not invested in it.  I am sure you are far too clever to have done that.",214
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Who could have advised you to do such a foolish thing?,216
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Who?,218
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"Ah! yes.  I remember hearing, at the time of his death, that he had been mixed up in the whole affair.",220
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"But you have not seen my Corots yet. They are in the music-room.  Corots seem to go with music, don’t they? May I show them to you?",222
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"I fear I have no advice to give you, Mrs. Cheveley, except to interest yourself in something less dangerous.  The success of the Canal depends, of course, on the attitude of England, and I am going to lay the report of the Commissioners before the House to-morrow night.",224
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"In my own interests? My dear Mrs. Cheveley, what do you mean?",226
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"Mrs. Cheveley, you cannot be serious in making me such a proposition!",228
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Pray allow me to believe that you are not.,230
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Pay me!,232
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,I am afraid I don’t quite understand what you mean.,234
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,I fear I don’t.,236
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"If you will allow me, I will call your carriage for you.  You have lived so long abroad, Mrs. Cheveley, that you seem to be unable to realise that you are talking to an English gentleman.",238
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,What do you mean?,240
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,What letter?,242
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,It is not true.,244
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,The affair to which you allude was no more than a speculation.  The House of Commons had not yet passed the bill; it might have been rejected.,246
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"It is infamous, what you propose—infamous!",248
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,I cannot do what you ask me.,250
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,What then?,252
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,What you ask is impossible.,254
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Stop!  You want me to withdraw the report and to make a short speech stating that I believe there are possibilities in the scheme?,256
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,I will give you any sum of money you want.,258
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,I will not do what you ask me.  I will not.,260
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"Wait a moment!  What did you propose?  You said that you would give me back my letter, didn’t you?",262
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,You must let me have time to consider your proposal.,264
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Give me a week—three days!,266
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,My God! what brought you into my life?,268
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Don’t go.  I consent.  The report shall be withdrawn.  I will arrange for a question to be put to me on the subject.,270
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"Your carriage is here, Mrs. Cheveley!",286
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"My dear Arthur, you are not going?  Do stop a little!",318
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"How beautiful you look to-night, Gertrude!",320
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Who told you I intended to do so?,322
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"Gertrude, what you tell me may be true, but it happened many years ago.  It is best forgotten!  Mrs. Cheveley may have changed since then.  No one should be entirely judged by their past.",324
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"That is a hard saying, Gertrude!",326
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,I was mistaken in the view I took.  We all may make mistakes.,328
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"I have reasons now to believe that the Commission was prejudiced, or, at any rate, misinformed. Besides, Gertrude, public and private life are different things.  They have different laws, and move on different lines.",330
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"In the present case, on a matter of practical politics, I have changed my mind.  That is all.",332
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Yes!,334
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Why do you ask me such a question?,336
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"Gertrude, truth is a very complex thing, and politics is a very complex business.  There are wheels within wheels.  One may be under certain obligations to people that one must pay.  Sooner or later in political life one has to compromise. Every one does.",338
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,I am not changed.  But circumstances alter things.,340
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,But if I told you—,342
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"That it was necessary, vitally necessary?",344
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"Gertrude, you have no right to use that word.  I told you it was a question of rational compromise.  It is no more than that.",346
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Gertrude!,348
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,That what?,350
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Drift apart?,352
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"Gertrude, there is nothing in my past life that you might not know.",354
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Must I write and tell her that?,356
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,I might see her personally.  It would be better.,358
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Write this moment!,360
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,But it is so late.  It is close on twelve.,362
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"Oh, love me always, Gertrude, love me always!",364
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"Put out the lights, Mason, put out the lights!",366
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"Arthur, I couldn’t tell my wife.  When could I have told her?  Not last night.  It would have made a life-long separation between us, and I would have lost the love of the one woman in the world I worship, of the only woman who has ever stirred love within me.  Last night it would have been quite impossible.  She would have turned from me in horror . . . in horror and in contempt.",369
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Yes; my wife is as perfect as all that.,371
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,It would be quite useless.,373
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Yes; but nothing could make her alter her views.,375
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,All such experiments are terribly dangerous.,377
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"When?  When we were engaged?  Do you think she would have married me if she had known that the origin of my fortune is such as it is, the basis of my career such as it is, and that I had done a thing that I suppose most men would call shameful and dishonourable?",379
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"Men who every day do something of the same kind themselves.  Men who, each one of them, have worse secrets in their own lives.",381
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"And, after all, whom did I wrong by what I did?  No one.",383
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"Of course I had private information about a certain transaction contemplated by the Government of the day, and I acted on it.  Private information is practically the source of every large modern fortune.",385
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"Arthur, do you think that what I did nearly eighteen years ago should be brought up against me now?  Do you think it fair that a man’s whole career should be ruined for a fault done in one’s boyhood almost?  I was twenty-two at the time, and I had the double misfortune of being well-born and poor, two unforgiveable things nowadays.  Is it fair that the folly, the sin of one’s youth, if men choose to call it a sin, should wreck a life like mine, should place me in the pillory, should shatter all that I have worked for, all that I have built up.  Is it fair, Arthur?",387
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Every man of ambition has to fight his century with its own weapons.  What this century worships is wealth.  The God of this century is wealth.  To succeed one must have wealth.  At all costs one must have wealth.,389
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"When I was old, perhaps.  When I had lost my passion for power, or could not use it.  When I was tired, worn out, disappointed.  I wanted my success when I was young.  Youth is the time for success.  I couldn’t wait.",391
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,And if it is all taken away from me now?  If I lose everything over a horrible scandal?  If I am hounded from public life?,393
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,I did not sell myself for money.  I bought success at a great price.  That is all.,395
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Baron Arnheim.,397
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"No; he was a man of a most subtle and refined intellect.  A man of culture, charm, and distinction.  One of the most intellectual men I ever met.",399
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"One night after dinner at Lord Radley’s the Baron began talking about success in modern life as something that one could reduce to an absolutely definite science.  With that wonderfully fascinating quiet voice of his he expounded to us the most terrible of all philosophies, the philosophy of power, preached to us the most marvellous of all gospels, the gospel of gold.  I think he saw the effect he had produced on me, for some days afterwards he wrote and asked me to come and see him.  He was living then in Park Lane, in the house Lord Woolcomb has now.  I remember so well how, with a strange smile on his pale, curved lips, he led me through his wonderful picture gallery, showed me his tapestries, his enamels, his jewels, his carved ivories, made me wonder at the strange loveliness of the luxury in which he lived; and then told me that luxury was nothing but a background, a painted scene in a play, and that power, power over other men, power over the world, was the one thing worth having, the one supreme pleasure worth knowing, the one joy one never tired of, and that in our century only the rich possessed it.",401
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"I didn’t think so then.  I don’t think so now.  Wealth has given me enormous power.  It gave me at the very outset of my life freedom, and freedom is everything.  You have never been poor, and never known what ambition is.  You cannot understand what a wonderful chance the Baron gave me.  Such a chance as few men get.",403
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"When I was going away he said to me that if I ever could give him any private information of real value he would make me a very rich man.  I was dazed at the prospect he held out to me, and my ambition and my desire for power were at that time boundless.  Six weeks later certain private documents passed through my hands.",405
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Yes.,407
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"Weak?  Oh, I am sick of hearing that phrase.  Sick of using it about others.  Weak?  Do you really think, Arthur, that it is weakness that yields to temptation?  I tell you that there are terrible temptations that it requires strength, strength and courage, to yield to. To stake all one’s life on a single moment, to risk everything on one throw, whether the stake be power or pleasure, I care not—there is no weakness in that.  There is a horrible, a terrible courage.  I had that courage.  I sat down the same afternoon and wrote Baron Arnheim the letter this woman now holds.  He made three-quarters of a million over the transaction.",409
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"I received from the Baron £110,000.",411
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"No; that money gave me exactly what I wanted, power over others.  I went into the House immediately.  The Baron advised me in finance from time to time.  Before five years I had almost trebled my fortune.  Since then everything that I have touched has turned out a success.  In all things connected with money I have had a luck so extraordinary that sometimes it has made me almost afraid.  I remember having read somewhere, in some strange book, that when the gods wish to punish us they answer our prayers.",413
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"No.  I felt that I had fought the century with its own weapons, and won.",415
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"I thought so.  Arthur, do you despise me for what I have told you?",417
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"I don’t say that I suffered any remorse.  I didn’t. Not remorse in the ordinary, rather silly sense of the word.  But I have paid conscience money many times.  I had a wild hope that I might disarm destiny.  The sum Baron Arnheim gave me I have distributed twice over in public charities since then.",419
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"Oh, don’t say that, Arthur; don’t talk like that!",421
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"Thank you, Arthur, thank you.  But what is to be done?  What can be done?",423
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"It would ruin me.  Arthur, the only thing for me to do now is to fight the thing out.",425
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,That I will not do.,427
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"I couldn’t do it.  It would kill her love for me. And now about this woman, this Mrs. Cheveley.  How can I defend myself against her?  You knew her before, Arthur, apparently.",429
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Did you know her well?,431
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Why was it broken off?,433
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,I offered her any sum she wanted.  She refused.,435
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"Not everything.  I suppose you are right.  Arthur, I feel that public disgrace is in store for me.  I feel certain of it.  I never knew what terror was before.  I know it now.  It is as if a hand of ice were laid upon one’s heart.  It is as if one’s heart were beating itself to death in some empty hollow.",437
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,But how?,439
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"In defending myself against Mrs. Cheveley, I have a right to use any weapon I can find, have I not?",441
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"Well, I shall send a cipher telegram to the Embassy at Vienna, to inquire if there is anything known against her.  There may be some secret scandal she might be afraid of.",443
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Why do you say that?,445
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"But it is worth while my wiring to Vienna, is it not?",447
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Is Mr. Trafford in his room?,449
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Tell him to have this sent off in cipher at once.  There must not be a moment’s delay.,451
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Oh! just give that back to me again.,453
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,She must have had some curious hold over Baron Arnheim.  I wonder what it was.,454
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"I will fight her to the death, as long as my wife knows nothing.",456
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"If my wife found out, there would be little left to fight for.  Well, as soon as I hear from Vienna, I shall let you know the result.  It is a chance, just a chance, but I believe in it.  And as I fought the age with its own weapons, I will fight her with her weapons.  It is only fair, and she looks like a woman with a past, doesn’t she?",458
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"Oh! I live on hopes now.  I clutch at every chance. I feel like a man on a ship that is sinking.  The water is round my feet, and the very air is bitter with storm.  Hush! I hear my wife’s voice.",460
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"You have been a good friend to me, Arthur, a thoroughly good friend.",472
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,You have enabled me to tell you the truth.  That is something.  The truth has always stifled me.,474
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"I would to God that I had been able to tell the truth . . . to live the truth.  Ah! that is the great thing in life, to live the truth.  I’ll see you soon again, Arthur, shan’t I?",476
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Thank you.,478
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"I have some letters to write, dear.",480
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"It is nothing, dear, nothing.",482
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Go!  Go at once.  You have done your worst now.,632
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Show Mrs. Cheveley out.,634
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"What this woman said is quite true.  But, Gertrude, listen to me.  You don’t realise how I was tempted.  Let me tell you the whole thing.",636
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Gertrude!  Gertrude!,638
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"There was your mistake.  There was your error.  The error all women commit.  Why can’t you women love us, faults and all? Why do you place us on monstrous pedestals?  We have all feet of clay, women as well as men; but when we men love women, we love them knowing their weaknesses, their follies, their imperfections, love them all the more, it may be, for that reason.  It is not the perfect, but the imperfect, who have need of love.  It is when we are wounded by our own hands, or by the hands of others, that love should come to cure us—else what use is love at all?  All sins, except a sin against itself, Love should forgive.  All lives, save loveless lives, true Love should pardon. A man’s love is like that.  It is wider, larger, more human than a woman’s.  Women think that they are making ideals of men.  What they are making of us are false idols merely.  You made your false idol of me, and I had not the courage to come down, show you my wounds, tell you my weaknesses.  I was afraid that I might lose your love, as I have lost it now.  And so, last night you ruined my life for me—yes, ruined it!  What this woman asked of me was nothing compared to what she offered to me. She offered security, peace, stability.  The sin of my youth, that I had thought was buried, rose up in front of me, hideous, horrible, with its hands at my throat.  I could have killed it for ever, sent it back into its tomb, destroyed its record, burned the one witness against me.  You prevented me.  No one but you, you know it.  And now what is there before me but public disgrace, ruin, terrible shame, the mockery of the world, a lonely dishonoured life, a lonely dishonoured death, it may be, some day? Let women make no more ideals of men! let them not put them on altars and bow before them, or they may ruin other lives as completely as you—you whom I have so wildly loved—have ruined mine!",640
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"My dear Arthur, what a piece of good luck meeting you on the doorstep!  Your servant had just told me you were not at home. How extraordinary!",752
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"Ah! you must be at home to me, Arthur.  You are my best friend.  Perhaps by to-morrow you will be my only friend.  My wife has discovered everything.",754
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Really!  How?,756
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"Mrs. Cheveley herself.  And the woman I love knows that I began my career with an act of low dishonesty, that I built up my life upon sands of shame—that I sold, like a common huckster, the secret that had been intrusted to me as a man of honour.  I thank heaven poor Lord Radley died without knowing that I betrayed him.  I would to God I had died before I had been so horribly tempted, or had fallen so low.",758
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Yes; I got a telegram from the first secretary at eight o’clock to-night.,760
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"Nothing is absolutely known against her.  On the contrary, she occupies a rather high position in society.  It is a sort of open secret that Baron Arnheim left her the greater portion of his immense fortune.  Beyond that I can learn nothing.",762
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Oh! spies are of no use nowadays.  Their profession is over.  The newspapers do their work instead.,764
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"Arthur, I am parched with thirst.  May I ring for something?  Some hock and seltzer?",766
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"Thanks!  I don’t know what to do, Arthur, I don’t know what to do, and you are my only friend.  But what a friend you are—the one friend I can trust.  I can trust you absolutely, can’t I?",768
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Certainly.,774
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"Arthur, tell me what I should do.  My life seems to have crumbled about me.  I am a ship without a rudder in a night without a star.",778
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"I love her more than anything in the world.  I used to think ambition the great thing.  It is not.  Love is the great thing in the world.  There is nothing but love, and I love her.  But I am defamed in her eyes.  I am ignoble in her eyes.  There is a wide gulf between us now.  She has found me out, Arthur, she has found me out.",780
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"My wife!  Never!  She does not know what weakness or temptation is.  I am of clay like other men.  She stands apart as good women do—pitiless in her perfection—cold and stern and without mercy. But I love her, Arthur.  We are childless, and I have no one else to love, no one else to love me.  Perhaps if God had sent us children she might have been kinder to me.  But God has given us a lonely house.  And she has cut my heart in two.  Don’t let us talk of it.  I was brutal to her this evening.  But I suppose when sinners talk to saints they are brutal always.  I said to her things that were hideously true, on my side, from my stand-point, from the standpoint of men.  But don’t let us talk of that.",782
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"God grant it!  God grant it!  But there is something more I have to tell you, Arthur.",784
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Thank you.,786
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,No; I walked from the club.,788
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"Arthur, you must let me stay for five minutes.  I have made up my mind what I am going to do to-night in the House.  The debate on the Argentine Canal is to begin at eleven.  What is that?",792
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,I heard a chair fall in the next room.  Some one has been listening.,794
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"There is some one.  There are lights in the room, and the door is ajar.  Some one has been listening to every secret of my life.  Arthur, what does this mean?",796
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Do you give me your word that there is no one there?,798
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Your word of honour?,800
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"Arthur, let me see for myself.",802
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"If there is no one there why should I not look in that room?  Arthur, you must let me go into that room and satisfy myself. Let me know that no eavesdropper has heard my life’s secret.  Arthur, you don’t realise what I am going through.",804
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"It is not enough.  I insist on going into this room.  You have told me there is no one there, so what reason can you have for refusing me?",806
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"Ah, I thought so!",808
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Stand back.  My life is at stake.  And I don’t care who is there.  I will know who it is to whom I have told my secret and my shame.,810
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,What explanation have you to give me for the presence of that woman here?,812
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"She is a vile, an infamous thing!",814
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"You are mad.  What have I to do with her intrigues with you?  Let her remain your mistress!  You are well suited to each other.  She, corrupt and shameful—you, false as a friend, treacherous as an enemy even—",816
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"Let me pass, sir.  You have lied enough upon your word of honour.",818
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"‘I want you.  I trust you.  I am coming to you. Gertrude.’  Oh, my love!  Is this true?  Do you indeed trust me, and want me?  If so, it was for me to come to you, not for you to write of coming to me.  This letter of yours, Gertrude, makes me feel that nothing that the world may do can hurt me now.  You want me, Gertrude?",1080
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"You trust me, Gertrude?",1082
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Ah! why did you not add you loved me?,1084
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"Gertrude, you don’t know what I feel.  When Montford passed me your letter across the table—he had opened it by mistake, I suppose, without looking at the handwriting on the envelope—and I read it—oh! I did not care what disgrace or punishment was in store for me, I only thought you loved me still.",1086
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"Are you sure of this, Gertrude?",1088
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Then I am safe!  Oh! what a wonderful thing to be safe!  For two days I have been in terror.  I am safe now.  How did Arthur destroy my letter?  Tell me.,1090
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,I wish I had seen that one sin of my youth burning to ashes.  How many men there are in modern life who would like to see their past burning to white ashes before them!  Is Arthur still here?,1092
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"I am so glad now I made that speech last night in the House, so glad.  I made it thinking that public disgrace might be the result.  But it has not been so.",1094
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"I think so.  I fear so, almost.  For although I am safe from detection, although every proof against me is destroyed, I suppose, Gertrude . . . I suppose I should retire from public life?",1096
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,It is much to surrender.,1098
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"And you would be happy living somewhere alone with me, abroad perhaps, or in the country away from London, away from public life?  You would have no regrets?",1100
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,And your ambition for me?  You used to be ambitious for me.,1102
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"Arthur, I have to thank you for what you have done for me.  I don’t know how I can repay you.",1104
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,A seat in the Cabinet?,1109
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,A seat in the Cabinet!,1111
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"I cannot accept this offer, Lord Caversham.  I have made up my mind to decline it.",1114
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,My intention is to retire at once from public life.,1116
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"I suppose I had better write it at once.  Such offers are not repeated.  I will ask you to excuse me for a moment, Lord Caversham.",1123
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"Yes, Gertrude.",1125
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"Gertrude, here is the draft of my letter.  Shall I read it to you?",1147
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,What are you doing?,1149
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Gertrude!  Gertrude!,1151
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"My wife! my wife!  Arthur, it seems that I am always to be in your debt.",1153
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,I owe you much.  And now tell me what you were going to ask me just now as Lord Caversham came in.,1155
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,My sister to be your wife?,1159
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"Arthur, I am very sorry, but the thing is quite out of the question.  I have to think of Mabel’s future happiness.  And I don’t think her happiness would be safe in your hands.  And I cannot have her sacrificed!",1161
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"Yes, utterly sacrificed.  Loveless marriages are horrible.  But there is one thing worse than an absolutely loveless marriage.  A marriage in which there is love, but on one side only; faith, but on one side only; devotion, but on one side only, and in which of the two hearts one is sure to be broken.",1163
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Arthur cannot bring Mabel the love that she deserves.,1166
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Do you really require me to tell you?,1168
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"As you choose.  When I called on you yesterday evening I found Mrs. Cheveley concealed in your rooms.  It was between ten and eleven o’clock at night.  I do not wish to say anything more. Your relations with Mrs. Cheveley have, as I said to you last night, nothing whatsoever to do with me.  I know you were engaged to be married to her once.  The fascination she exercised over you then seems to have returned.  You spoke to me last night of her as of a woman pure and stainless, a woman whom you respected and honoured.  That may be so.  But I cannot give my sister’s life into your hands.  It would be wrong of me. It would be unjust, infamously unjust to her.",1170
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,Not Mrs. Cheveley!  Who was it then?,1173
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"What!  Had I fallen so low in your eyes that you thought that even for a moment I could have doubted your goodness? Gertrude, Gertrude, you are to me the white image of all good things, and sin can never touch you.  Arthur, you can go to Mabel, and you have my best wishes!  Oh! stop a moment.  There is no name at the beginning of this letter.  The brilliant Mrs. Cheveley does not seem to have noticed that.  There should be a name.",1176
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN,"Gertrude, is it love you feel for me, or is it pity merely?",1196
LORD GORING,"I did not think you would remember me, Mrs. Cheveley.",104
LORD GORING,Oh! I am not at all romantic.  I am not old enough.  I leave romance to my seniors.,108
LORD GORING,May I ask are you staying in London long?,111
LORD GORING,Have you missed me?,116
LORD GORING,Then I am sorry I did not stay away longer.  I like being missed.,118
LORD GORING,I am very selfish.,120
LORD GORING,"I have only told you half of them as yet, Miss Mabel!",122
LORD GORING,Quite dreadful!  When I think of them at night I go to sleep at once.,124
LORD GORING,"How very nice of you!  But then you are always nice.  By the way, I want to ask you a question, Miss Mabel.  Who brought Mrs. Cheveley here?  That woman in heliotrope, who has just gone out of the room with your brother?",126
LORD GORING,"I haven’t seen her for years, that is all.",128
LORD GORING,All reasons are absurd.,130
LORD GORING,Oh! a genius in the daytime and a beauty at night!,132
LORD GORING,That shows your admirable good taste.,134
LORD GORING,So the newspapers are always telling us.,136
LORD GORING,"Then, my dear Nanjac, you must certainly read between the lines.",138
LORD GORING,"Not if there is any music going on, Miss Mabel.",141
LORD GORING,"Only a quarter to four, father.",144
LORD GORING,"I love talking about nothing, father.  It is the only thing I know anything about.",146
LORD GORING,"What else is there to live for, father?  Nothing ages like happiness.",148
LORD GORING,"I hope not, father.  Good evening, Lady Basildon!",150
LORD GORING,I adore political parties.  They are the only place left to us where people don’t talk politics.,152
LORD GORING,By never listening.,154
LORD GORING,"Of course.  You see, it is a very dangerous thing to listen.  If one listens one may be convinced; and a man who allows himself to be convinced by an argument is a thoroughly unreasonable person.",156
LORD GORING,And those are the views of the two ladies who are known to have the most admirable husbands in London.,160
LORD GORING,"How terrible!  Really, the thing should be more widely known!",162
LORD GORING,I should have thought it was the husbands who were punished.,165
LORD GORING,"Or comic, Lady Basildon?",168
LORD GORING,"Handsome woman, Mrs. Cheveley!",171
LORD GORING,I did wait.,173
LORD GORING,"She is quite right, too.  The men are all dowdies and the women are all dandies, aren’t they?",175
LORD GORING,"Of course.  And a very sensible remark for Mrs. Cheveley to make, too.",177
LORD GORING,"Ah! that is morbid of you, Mrs. Marchmont!",181
LORD GORING,"With pleasure, Miss Mabel.",186
LORD GORING,How could I?  You went away with the child-diplomatist.,188
LORD GORING,I like you immensely.,190
LORD GORING,"If you wish it, Mrs. Cheveley!",288
LORD GORING,"You should go to bed, Miss Mabel.",291
LORD GORING,My father told me to go to bed an hour ago.  I don’t see why I shouldn’t give you the same advice.  I always pass on good advice. It is the only thing to do with it.  It is never of any use to oneself.,293
LORD GORING,I wonder who dropped it.,295
LORD GORING,It is a handsome bracelet.,297
LORD GORING,It can be used as a bracelet.,299
LORD GORING,"Miss Mabel, I am going to make a rather strange request to you.",301
LORD GORING,"Don’t mention to anybody that I have taken charge of this brooch.  Should any one write and claim it, let me know at once.",303
LORD GORING,"Well, you see I gave this brooch to somebody once, years ago.",305
LORD GORING,Yes.,307
LORD GORING,Yes.  It was an unpleasant surprise.  What did she come here for?,310
LORD GORING,"She has mistaken her man, hasn’t she?",312
LORD GORING,Yes.  I should fancy she came to grief if she tried to get Robert into her toils.  It is extraordinary what astounding mistakes clever women make.,314
LORD GORING,"Same thing often.  Good-night, Lady Chiltern!",316
LORD GORING,"Afraid I can’t, thanks.  I have promised to look in at the Hartlocks’.  I believe they have got a mauve Hungarian band that plays mauve Hungarian music.  See you soon.  Good-bye!",319
LORD GORING,"My dear Robert, it’s a very awkward business, very awkward indeed.  You should have told your wife the whole thing.  Secrets from other people’s wives are a necessary luxury in modern life.  So, at least, I am always told at the club by people who are bald enough to know better.  But no man should have a secret from his own wife.  She invariably finds it out.  Women have a wonderful instinct about things. They can discover everything except the obvious.",368
LORD GORING,Is Lady Chiltern as perfect as all that?,370
LORD GORING,"What a pity!  I beg your pardon, my dear fellow, I didn’t quite mean that.  But if what you tell me is true, I should like to have a serious talk about life with Lady Chiltern.",372
LORD GORING,May I try?,374
LORD GORING,"Well, at the worst it would simply be a psychological experiment.",376
LORD GORING,"Everything is dangerous, my dear fellow.  If it wasn’t so, life wouldn’t be worth living. . . . Well, I am bound to say that I think you should have told her years ago.",378
LORD GORING,Yes; most men would call it ugly names.  There is no doubt of that.,380
LORD GORING,That is the reason they are so pleased to find out other people’s secrets.  It distracts public attention from their own.,382
LORD GORING,"Except yourself, Robert.",384
LORD GORING,And public scandal invariably the result.,386
LORD GORING,"Life is never fair, Robert.  And perhaps it is a good thing for most of us that it is not.",388
LORD GORING,"You underrate yourself, Robert.  Believe me, without wealth you could have succeeded just as well.",390
LORD GORING,"Well, you certainly have had your success while you are still young.  No one in our day has had such a brilliant success. Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs at the age of forty—that’s good enough for any one, I should think.",392
LORD GORING,"Robert, how could you have sold yourself for money?",394
LORD GORING,Yes; you certainly paid a great price for it. But what first made you think of doing such a thing?,396
LORD GORING,Damned scoundrel!,398
LORD GORING,"Ah! I prefer a gentlemanly fool any day.  There is more to be said for stupidity than people imagine.  Personally I have a great admiration for stupidity.  It is a sort of fellow-feeling, I suppose. But how did he do it?  Tell me the whole thing.",400
LORD GORING,A thoroughly shallow creed.,402
LORD GORING,"Fortunately for them, if one is to judge by results.  But tell me definitely, how did the Baron finally persuade you to—well, to do what you did?",404
LORD GORING,State documents?,406
LORD GORING,"I had no idea that you, of all men in the world, could have been so weak, Robert, as to yield to such a temptation as Baron Arnheim held out to you.",408
LORD GORING,And you?,410
LORD GORING,"You were worth more, Robert.",412
LORD GORING,"But tell me, Robert, did you never suffer any regret for what you had done?",414
LORD GORING,You thought you had won.,416
LORD GORING,"I am very sorry for you, Robert, very sorry indeed.",418
LORD GORING,"In public charities?  Dear me! what a lot of harm you must have done, Robert!",420
LORD GORING,"Never mind what I say, Robert!  I am always saying what I shouldn’t say.  In fact, I usually say what I really think.  A great mistake nowadays.  It makes one so liable to be misunderstood.  As regards this dreadful business, I will help you in whatever way I can. Of course you know that.",422
LORD GORING,"Well, the English can’t stand a man who is always saying he is in the right, but they are very fond of a man who admits that he has been in the wrong.  It is one of the best things in them.  However, in your case, Robert, a confession would not do.  The money, if you will allow me to say so, is . . . awkward.  Besides, if you did make a clean breast of the whole affair, you would never be able to talk morality again.  And in England a man who can’t talk morality twice a week to a large, popular, immoral audience is quite over as a serious politician.  There would be nothing left for him as a profession except Botany or the Church.  A confession would be of no use.  It would ruin you.",424
LORD GORING,"I was waiting for you to say that, Robert.  It is the only thing to do now.  And you must begin by telling your wife the whole story.",426
LORD GORING,"Robert, believe me, you are wrong.",428
LORD GORING,Yes.,430
LORD GORING,"So little that I got engaged to be married to her once, when I was staying at the Tenbys’.  The affair lasted for three days . . . nearly.",432
LORD GORING,"Oh, I forget.  At least, it makes no matter. By the way, have you tried her with money?  She used to be confoundedly fond of money.",434
LORD GORING,"Then the marvellous gospel of gold breaks down sometimes. The rich can’t do everything, after all.",436
LORD GORING,"Robert, you must fight her.  You must fight her.",438
LORD GORING,I can’t tell you how at present.  I have not the smallest idea.  But every one has some weak point.  There is some flaw in each one of us. My father tells me that even I have faults.  Perhaps I have.  I don’t know.,440
LORD GORING,In your place I don’t think I should have the smallest scruple in doing so.  She is thoroughly well able to take care of herself.,442
LORD GORING,"Oh, I should fancy Mrs. Cheveley is one of those very modern women of our time who find a new scandal as becoming as a new bonnet, and air them both in the Park every afternoon at five-thirty.  I am sure she adores scandals, and that the sorrow of her life at present is that she can’t manage to have enough of them.",444
LORD GORING,"Well, she wore far too much rouge last night, and not quite enough clothes.  That is always a sign of despair in a woman.",446
LORD GORING,"It is always worth while asking a question, though it is not always worth while answering one.",448
LORD GORING,I wonder.,455
LORD GORING,"Oh, fight in any case—in any case.",457
LORD GORING,"Most pretty women do.  But there is a fashion in pasts just as there is a fashion in frocks.  Perhaps Mrs. Cheveley’s past is merely a slightly décolleté one, and they are excessively popular nowadays. Besides, my dear Robert, I should not build too high hopes on frightening Mrs. Cheveley.  I should not fancy Mrs. Cheveley is a woman who would be easily frightened.  She has survived all her creditors, and she shows wonderful presence of mind.",459
LORD GORING,"Good afternoon, Lady Chiltern!  Have you been in the Park?",462
LORD GORING,"I’ll wait for a short time, thanks.",464
LORD GORING,Oh! please don’t.  It is so pretty.  One of the prettiest hats I ever saw.  I hope the Woman’s Liberal Association received it with loud applause.,466
LORD GORING,Really?  What sort of work?,468
LORD GORING,And never bonnets?,470
LORD GORING,"I don’t know that I have been able to do much for you, Robert, as yet.  In fact, I have not been able to do anything for you, as far as I can see.  I am thoroughly disappointed with myself.",473
LORD GORING,"Ah! the truth is a thing I get rid of as soon as possible! Bad habit, by the way.  Makes one very unpopular at the club . . . with the older members.  They call it being conceited.  Perhaps it is.",475
LORD GORING,"Certainly.  Whenever you like.  I’m going to look in at the Bachelors’ Ball to-night, unless I find something better to do.  But I’ll come round to-morrow morning.  If you should want me to-night by any chance, send round a note to Curzon Street.",477
LORD GORING,You want to talk to me about Mrs. Cheveley?,484
LORD GORING,So he gave me to understand.,486
LORD GORING,He certainly has no secrets from me.  At least I don’t think so.,488
LORD GORING,Quite frankly?,490
LORD GORING,"Nothing.  But, my dear Lady Chiltern, I think, if you will allow me to say so, that in practical life—",492
LORD GORING,"Of which I know nothing by experience, though I know something by observation.  I think that in practical life there is something about success, actual success, that is a little unscrupulous, something about ambition that is unscrupulous always.  Once a man has set his heart and soul on getting to a certain point, if he has to climb the crag, he climbs the crag; if he has to walk in the mire—",494
LORD GORING,He walks in the mire.  Of course I am only talking generally about life.,496
LORD GORING,"Lady Chiltern, I have sometimes thought that . . . perhaps you are a little hard in some of your views on life.  I think that . . . often you don’t make sufficient allowances.  In every nature there are elements of weakness, or worse than weakness.  Supposing, for instance, that—that any public man, my father, or Lord Merton, or Robert, say, had, years ago, written some foolish letter to some one . . .",498
LORD GORING,A letter gravely compromising one’s position.  I am only putting an imaginary case.,500
LORD GORING,Nobody is incapable of doing a foolish thing.  Nobody is incapable of doing a wrong thing.,502
LORD GORING,"No, Lady Chiltern, I am not a Pessimist. Indeed I am not sure that I quite know what Pessimism really means.  All I do know is that life cannot be understood without much charity, cannot be lived without much charity.  It is love, and not German philosophy, that is the true explanation of this world, whatever may be the explanation of the next.  And if you are ever in trouble, Lady Chiltern, trust me absolutely, and I will help you in every way I can.  If you ever want me, come to me for my assistance, and you shall have it.  Come at once to me.",504
LORD GORING,"You must excuse me, Lady Chiltern.  It won’t occur again, if I can help it.",506
LORD GORING,"I should like to, Miss Mabel, but I am afraid I am . . . a little out of practice this morning; and besides, I have to be going now.",509
LORD GORING,I was.,511
LORD GORING,I am so sorry you didn’t.,513
LORD GORING,I am not so sure.,515
LORD GORING,"Yes, at ten.",517
LORD GORING,"Of course I shan’t.  By the way, Lady Chiltern, there is no list of your guests in _The Morning Post_ of to-day.  It has apparently been crowded out by the County Council, or the Lambeth Conference, or something equally boring.  Could you let me have a list?  I have a particular reason for asking you.",519
LORD GORING,"Thanks, so much.",521
LORD GORING,"How clever of you to guess it!  Good-bye, Lady Chiltern!  You will remember what I said to you, won’t you?",523
LORD GORING,"I hardly know myself.  Good-bye, Miss Mabel!",525
LORD GORING,How very selfish of you to have four and a half!  There won’t be any left for me.,526
LORD GORING,That is the first unkind thing you have ever said to me. How charmingly you said it!  Ten to-morrow.,528
LORD GORING,Quite sharp.  But don’t bring Mr. Trafford.,530
LORD GORING,I am delighted to hear it.,532
LORD GORING,"Got my second buttonhole for me, Phipps?",642
LORD GORING,"Rather distinguished thing, Phipps.  I am the only person of the smallest importance in London at present who wears a buttonhole.",644
LORD GORING,"You see, Phipps, Fashion is what one wears oneself.  What is unfashionable is what other people wear.",646
LORD GORING,Just as vulgarity is simply the conduct of other people.,648
LORD GORING,And falsehoods the truths of other people.,650
LORD GORING,Other people are quite dreadful.  The only possible society is oneself.,652
LORD GORING,"To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance, Phipps.",654
LORD GORING,"Don’t think I quite like this buttonhole, Phipps.  Makes me look a little too old.  Makes me almost in the prime of life, eh, Phipps?",656
LORD GORING,"You don’t, Phipps?",658
LORD GORING,"I am not quite sure.  For the future a more trivial buttonhole, Phipps, on Thursday evenings.",660
LORD GORING,Extraordinary thing about the lower classes in England—they are always losing their relations.,662
LORD GORING,"Hum!  Any letters, Phipps?",664
LORD GORING,Want my cab round in twenty minutes.,666
LORD GORING,"Ahem!  Phipps, when did this letter arrive?",668
LORD GORING,"That will do.  Lady Chiltern’s handwriting on Lady Chiltern’s pink notepaper.  That is rather curious. I thought Robert was to write.  Wonder what Lady Chiltern has got to say to me?  ‘I want you.  I trust you.  I am coming to you.  Gertrude.’  ‘I want you.  I trust you.  I am coming to you.’  So she has found out everything!  Poor woman!  Poor woman!  But what an hour to call!  Ten o’clock!  I shall have to give up going to the Berkshires.  However, it is always nice to be expected, and not to arrive.  I am not expected at the Bachelors’, so I shall certainly go there.  Well, I will make her stand by her husband. That is the only thing for her to do.  That is the only thing for any woman to do.  It is the growth of the moral sense in women that makes marriage such a hopeless, one-sided institution.  Ten o’clock.  She should be here soon.  I must tell Phipps I am not in to any one else.",670
LORD GORING,"Oh, why will parents always appear at the wrong time?  Some extraordinary mistake in nature, I suppose. Delighted to see you, my dear father.",672
LORD GORING,"Is it worth while, father?",674
LORD GORING,"This one, father.  It is the chair I use myself, when I have visitors.",676
LORD GORING,"No, father.",678
LORD GORING,"Good many breezes, father.",680
LORD GORING,My dear father!  At this hour?,682
LORD GORING,"Well, the fact is, father, this is not my day for talking seriously.  I am very sorry, but it is not my day.",684
LORD GORING,"During the Season, father, I only talk seriously on the first Tuesday in every month, from four to seven.",686
LORD GORING,"But it is after seven, father, and my doctor says I must not have any serious conversation after seven.  It makes me talk in my sleep.",688
LORD GORING,"No, father, I am not married.",690
LORD GORING,"I think I shall, father.",692
LORD GORING,"I hope not, father.",694
LORD GORING,"Yes, father, but I only admit to thirty-two—thirty-one and a half when I have a really good buttonhole.  This buttonhole is not . . . trivial enough.",696
LORD GORING,"So do I, father.  It is a dreadful draught.  I will come and see you to-morrow, father.  We can talk over anything you like.  Let me help you on with your cloak, father.",698
LORD GORING,"Certainly, father.  But let us go into another room. There is a dreadful draught here. Phipps, is there a good fire in the smoking-room?",700
LORD GORING,"Come in there, father.  Your sneezes are quite heartrending.",702
LORD GORING,"Quite so, father.  I was merely expressing sympathy.",704
LORD GORING,"I quite agree with you, father.  If there was less sympathy in the world there would be less trouble in the world.",706
LORD GORING,"So do I, father.  Everybody one meets is a paradox nowadays.  It is a great bore.  It makes society so obvious.",708
LORD GORING,"Yes, father, if I listen attentively.",710
LORD GORING,"Phipps, there is a lady coming to see me this evening on particular business.  Show her into the drawing-room when she arrives. You understand?",712
LORD GORING,"It is a matter of the gravest importance, Phipps.",714
LORD GORING,"No one else is to be admitted, under any circumstances.",716
LORD GORING,Ah! that is probably the lady.  I shall see her myself.,718
LORD GORING,"In a moment, father.  Do excuse me.  Well, remember my instructions, Phipps—into that room.",720
LORD GORING,"My dear father, if I am to get married, surely you will allow me to choose the time, place, and person? Particularly the person.",741
LORD GORING,"Yes.  In married life affection comes when people thoroughly dislike each other, father, doesn’t it?",743
LORD GORING,"But women who have common sense are so curiously plain, father, aren’t they?  Of course I only speak from hearsay.",745
LORD GORING,"Quite so.  And we men are so self-sacrificing that we never use it, do we, father?",747
LORD GORING,So my mother tells me.,749
LORD GORING,"I hope not, father.",751
LORD GORING,"The fact is, I am horribly busy to-night, Robert, and I gave orders I was not at home to any one.  Even my father had a comparatively cold reception.  He complained of a draught the whole time.",753
LORD GORING,Ah! I guessed as much!,755
LORD GORING,"Oh, merely by something in the expression of your face as you came in.  Who told her?",757
LORD GORING,"You have heard nothing from Vienna yet, in answer to your wire?",759
LORD GORING,Well?,761
LORD GORING,"She doesn’t turn out to be a spy, then?",763
LORD GORING,And thunderingly well they do it.,765
LORD GORING,Certainly.  Let me.,767
LORD GORING,"My dear Robert, of course.  Oh!  Bring some hock and seltzer.",769
LORD GORING,And Phipps!,771
LORD GORING,"Will you excuse me for a moment, Robert?  I want to give some directions to my servant.",773
LORD GORING,"When that lady calls, tell her that I am not expected home this evening.  Tell her that I have been suddenly called out of town. You understand?",775
LORD GORING,"You did perfectly right.  What a mess I am in.  No; I think I shall get through it.  I’ll give her a lecture through the door.  Awkward thing to manage, though.",777
LORD GORING,"Robert, you love your wife, don’t you?",779
LORD GORING,Has she never in her life done some folly—some indiscretion—that she should not forgive your sin?,781
LORD GORING,"Your wife will forgive you.  Perhaps at this moment she is forgiving you.  She loves you, Robert.  Why should she not forgive?",783
LORD GORING,"Is your carriage here, Robert?",787
LORD GORING,"Sir Robert will take my cab, Phipps.",789
LORD GORING,"Robert, you don’t mind my sending you away?",791
LORD GORING,Nothing.,793
LORD GORING,"No, no; there is no one there.",795
LORD GORING,"Robert, you are excited, unnerved.  I tell you there is no one in that room. Sit down, Robert.",797
LORD GORING,Yes.,799
LORD GORING,Yes.,801
LORD GORING,"No, no.",803
LORD GORING,"Robert, this must stop.  I have told you that there is no one in that room—that is enough.",805
LORD GORING,"For God’s sake, don’t!  There is some one there.  Some one whom you must not see.",807
LORD GORING,I forbid you to enter that room.,809
LORD GORING,Great heavens! his own wife!,811
LORD GORING,"Robert, I swear to you on my honour that that lady is stainless and guiltless of all offence towards you.",813
LORD GORING,"Don’t say that, Robert!  It was for your sake she came here.  It was to try and save you she came here.  She loves you and no one else.",815
LORD GORING,"It is not true, Robert.  Before heaven, it is not true.  In her presence and in yours I will explain all.",817
LORD GORING,Mrs. Cheveley!  Great heavens! . . . May I ask what you were doing in my drawing-room?,820
LORD GORING,Doesn’t that sound rather like tempting Providence?,822
LORD GORING,I am glad you have called.  I am going to give you some good advice.,824
LORD GORING,I see you are quite as wilful as you used to be.,826
LORD GORING,Too much experience is a dangerous thing.  Pray have a cigarette.  Half the pretty women in London smoke cigarettes.  Personally I prefer the other half.,828
LORD GORING,"You have come here to sell me Robert Chiltern’s letter, haven’t you?",830
LORD GORING,Because you haven’t mentioned the subject.  Have you got it with you?,832
LORD GORING,What is your price for it?,834
LORD GORING,"What do you want then, Mrs. Cheveley?",836
LORD GORING,I don’t like the name.,838
LORD GORING,Yes: that’s why.,840
LORD GORING,Yes.,842
LORD GORING,That was the natural result of my loving you.,844
LORD GORING,I am under the impression that my lawyer settled that matter with you on certain terms . . . dictated by yourself.,846
LORD GORING,Quite so.  That is why you pretended to love me.,848
LORD GORING,Yes.  I know lots of people think that.,850
LORD GORING,"My dear Mrs. Cheveley, you have always been far too clever to know anything about love.",852
LORD GORING,Yes: except that.,854
LORD GORING,Now?,856
LORD GORING,Are you really serious?,858
LORD GORING,I should make you a very bad husband.,860
LORD GORING,"You mean that you amused yourself immensely, don’t you?",862
LORD GORING,Nothing: but I can read it like a book.,864
LORD GORING,The Book of Numbers.,866
LORD GORING,"In the case of very fascinating women, sex is a challenge, not a defence.",868
LORD GORING,"Women are never disarmed by anything, as far as I know them.",870
LORD GORING,Oh! I do that as it is.  And self-sacrifice is a thing that should be put down by law.  It is so demoralising to the people for whom one sacrifices oneself.  They always go to the bad.,872
LORD GORING,"What you know about him is not his real character.  It was an act of folly done in his youth, dishonourable, I admit, shameful, I admit, unworthy of him, I admit, and therefore . . . not his true character.",874
LORD GORING,How you women war against each other!,876
LORD GORING,"Because you have brought a real tragedy into her life, I suppose.",878
LORD GORING,Lady Chiltern knows nothing of the kind of life to which you are alluding.,880
LORD GORING,"You mustn’t do that.  It would be vile, horrible, infamous.",882
LORD GORING,"With you?  No.  Your transaction with Robert Chiltern may pass as a loathsome commercial transaction of a loathsome commercial age; but you seem to have forgotten that you came here to-night to talk of love, you whose lips desecrated the word love, you to whom the thing is a book closely sealed, went this afternoon to the house of one of the most noble and gentle women in the world to degrade her husband in her eyes, to try and kill her love for him, to put poison in her heart, and bitterness in her life, to break her idol, and, it may be, spoil her soul.  That I cannot forgive you.  That was horrible.  For that there can be no forgiveness.",884
LORD GORING,A diamond snake-brooch with a ruby?,886
LORD GORING,"Because it is found.  In point of fact, I found it myself, and stupidly forgot to tell the butler anything about it as I was leaving. It is in this drawer.  No, that one.  This is the brooch, isn’t it?",888
LORD GORING,Won’t you wear it?,890
LORD GORING,Really?,892
LORD GORING,Yes; much better than when I saw it last.,894
LORD GORING,"Oh, ten years ago, on Lady Berkshire, from whom you stole it.",896
LORD GORING,"I mean that you stole that ornament from my cousin, Mary Berkshire, to whom I gave it when she was married.  Suspicion fell on a wretched servant, who was sent away in disgrace.  I recognised it last night.  I determined to say nothing about it till I had found the thief. I have found the thief now, and I have heard her own confession.",898
LORD GORING,"You know it is true.  Why, thief is written across your face at this moment.",900
LORD GORING,"The drawback of stealing a thing, Mrs. Cheveley, is that one never knows how wonderful the thing that one steals is.  You can’t get that bracelet off, unless you know where the spring is.  And I see you don’t know where the spring is.  It is rather difficult to find.",902
LORD GORING,Oh! don’t use big words.  They mean so little.,904
LORD GORING,I am going to ring for my servant.  He is an admirable servant.  Always comes in the moment one rings for him.  When he comes I will tell him to fetch the police.,906
LORD GORING,To-morrow the Berkshires will prosecute you.  That is what the police are for.,908
LORD GORING,Give me Robert Chiltern’s letter.,910
LORD GORING,Give me Robert Chiltern’s letter.,912
LORD GORING,You know you are lying.  Give it to me at once.  This is it?,914
LORD GORING,"For so well-dressed a woman, Mrs. Cheveley, you have moments of admirable common sense.  I congratulate you.",916
LORD GORING,Certainly.,918
LORD GORING,With pleasure.,920
LORD GORING,"Fortunately you have not the chance, Mrs. Cheveley.",922
LORD GORING,I am charmed to hear it.  It is a reformation.,924
LORD GORING,Well?,926
LORD GORING,What do you mean?,928
LORD GORING,Love-letter?,930
LORD GORING,"You wretched woman, must you always be thieving?  Give me back that letter.  I’ll take it from you by force.  You shall not leave my room till I have got it.",932
LORD GORING,It is a great nuisance.  I can’t find any one in this house to talk to.  And I am full of interesting information.  I feel like the latest edition of something or other.,935
LORD GORING,Lady Chiltern not down yet?,937
LORD GORING,Ah! that is something.,939
LORD GORING,Thank you!  Would you kindly tell him I’ve gone?,941
LORD GORING,"Really, I don’t want to meet my father three days running. It is a great deal too much excitement for any son.  I hope to goodness he won’t come up.  Fathers should be neither seen nor heard.  That is the only proper basis for family life.  Mothers are different.  Mothers are darlings.",943
LORD GORING,"My dear father, when one pays a visit it is for the purpose of wasting other people’s time, not one’s own.",945
LORD GORING,I have been thinking about nothing else.,947
LORD GORING,Not yet: but I hope to be before lunch-time.,949
LORD GORING,"Thanks awfully, but I think I’d sooner be engaged before lunch.",951
LORD GORING,"Neither do I, father.",953
LORD GORING,The Times?  Certainly not.  I only read _The Morning Post_.  All that one should know about modern life is where the Duchesses are; anything else is quite demoralising.,955
LORD GORING,Good heavens!  No.  What does it say?,957
LORD GORING,Ah!  Never heard of Canning.  Never wanted to.  And did . . . did Chiltern uphold the scheme?,959
LORD GORING,"I sincerely hope not, father.  However, I am delighted at what you tell me about Robert, thoroughly delighted.  It shows he has got pluck.",961
LORD GORING,"Ah! I prefer pluck.  It is not so common, nowadays, as genius is.",963
LORD GORING,"My dear father, only people who look dull ever get into the House of Commons, and only people who are dull ever succeed there.",965
LORD GORING,I am far too young.,967
LORD GORING,Youth isn’t an affectation.  Youth is an art.,969
LORD GORING,"I am of a very nervous disposition, especially in the morning.",971
LORD GORING,I don’t know how the betting stands to-day.,973
LORD GORING,That is just what I should like to marry.  A thoroughly sensible wife would reduce me to a condition of absolute idiocy in less than six months.,975
LORD GORING,"My dear father, if we men married the women we deserved, we should have a very bad time of it.",977
LORD GORING,"Good morning, Miss Mabel!",980
LORD GORING,"Good morning, Miss Mabel!",983
LORD GORING,"Good morning, Miss Mabel!",986
LORD GORING,"Oh, please don’t say such a thing.  You are the one person in London I really like to have to listen to me.",988
LORD GORING,It seems to me that I am a little in the way here.,995
LORD GORING,I don’t at all like knowing what people say of me behind my back.  It makes me far too conceited.,997
LORD GORING,Detestable.,1002
LORD GORING,I can’t help it.  I always look pleased when I am with you.,1004
LORD GORING,Of course it is.,1006
LORD GORING,"Please don’t, Miss Mabel.  I have something very particular to say to you.",1008
LORD GORING,"Well, yes, it is—I am bound to say it is.",1010
LORD GORING,The second to-day?  What conceited ass has been impertinent enough to dare to propose to you before I had proposed to you?,1012
LORD GORING,"You didn’t accept him, I hope?",1014
LORD GORING,Oh! bother Tommy Trafford.  Tommy is a silly little ass.  I love you.,1016
LORD GORING,"Mabel, do be serious.  Please be serious.",1018
LORD GORING,"Mabel, I have told you that I love you.  Can’t you love me a little in return?",1020
LORD GORING,Dear!  Do you know I was awfully afraid of being refused!,1022
LORD GORING,"Of course I’m not nearly good enough for you, Mabel.",1024
LORD GORING,And I’m . . . I’m a little over thirty.,1026
LORD GORING,How sweet of you to say so! . . . And it is only fair to tell you frankly that I am fearfully extravagant.,1028
LORD GORING,Must you really?,1030
LORD GORING,Then do tell her I want to talk to her particularly.  I have been waiting here all the morning to see either her or Robert.,1032
LORD GORING,No; that was a flash of genius.,1034
LORD GORING,My last.,1036
LORD GORING,"Dear Mabel, while you are away, there are none.  It makes me horribly dependent on you.",1038
LORD GORING,"Good morning, Lady Chiltern!",1042
LORD GORING,Second on the left?,1044
LORD GORING,"Lady Chiltern, I have a certain amount of very good news to tell you.  Mrs. Cheveley gave me up Robert’s letter last night, and I burned it.  Robert is safe.",1046
LORD GORING,There is only one person now that could be said to be in any danger.,1048
LORD GORING,Yourself.,1050
LORD GORING,"Danger is too great a word.  It is a word I should not have used.  But I admit I have something to tell you that may distress you, that terribly distresses me.  Yesterday evening you wrote me a very beautiful, womanly letter, asking me for my help.  You wrote to me as one of your oldest friends, one of your husband’s oldest friends.  Mrs. Cheveley stole that letter from my rooms.",1052
LORD GORING,"Lady Chiltern, I will be quite frank with you. Mrs. Cheveley puts a certain construction on that letter and proposes to send it to your husband.",1054
LORD GORING,"Mrs. Cheveley was concealed in a room adjoining my library, without my knowledge.  I thought that the person who was waiting in that room to see me was yourself.  Robert came in unexpectedly.  A chair or something fell in the room.  He forced his way in, and he discovered her. We had a terrible scene.  I still thought it was you.  He left me in anger.  At the end of everything Mrs. Cheveley got possession of your letter—she stole it, when or how, I don’t know.",1056
LORD GORING,At half-past ten.  And now I propose that we tell Robert the whole thing at once.,1058
LORD GORING,I think it is better that he should know the exact truth.,1060
LORD GORING,May I do it?,1062
LORD GORING,"You are wrong, Lady Chiltern.",1064
LORD GORING,"Pray be calm, Lady Chiltern, and answer the questions I am going to put to you.  You said his secretaries open his letters.",1066
LORD GORING,"Who is with him to-day?  Mr. Trafford, isn’t it?",1068
LORD GORING,You can trust him?,1070
LORD GORING,"He would do what you asked him, wouldn’t he?",1072
LORD GORING,"Your letter was on pink paper.  He could recognise it without reading it, couldn’t he?  By the colour?",1074
LORD GORING,Is he in the house now?,1076
LORD GORING,"Then I will go and see him myself, and tell him that a certain letter, written on pink paper, is to be forwarded to Robert to-day, and that at all costs it must not reach him.  Oh! Robert is coming upstairs with the letter in his hand.  It has reached him already.",1078
LORD GORING,"My dear fellow, I’ll tell you at once.  At the present moment, under the usual palm tree . . . I mean in the conservatory . . .",1105
LORD GORING,"That admirable father of mine really makes a habit of turning up at the wrong moment.  It is very heartless of him, very heartless indeed.",1107
LORD GORING,"I don’t like principles, father.  I prefer prejudices.",1113
LORD GORING,"No, father.",1118
LORD GORING,"It is not idiocy, father, I assure you.",1127
LORD GORING,"Well, it is what is called nowadays a high moral tone, father.  That is all.",1129
LORD GORING,"Oh! just go in here for a moment, father.  Third palm tree to the left, the usual palm tree.",1131
LORD GORING,"I beg your pardon, father, I forgot.  The conservatory, father, the conservatory—there is some one there I want you to talk to.",1133
LORD GORING,"About me, father.",1135
LORD GORING,"No, father; but the lady is like me.  She doesn’t care much for eloquence in others.  She thinks it a little loud.",1137
LORD GORING,"Lady Chiltern, why are you playing Mrs. Cheveley’s cards?",1138
LORD GORING,"Mrs. Cheveley made an attempt to ruin your husband.  Either to drive him from public life, or to make him adopt a dishonourable position.  From the latter tragedy you saved him.  The former you are now thrusting on him.  Why should you do him the wrong Mrs. Cheveley tried to do and failed?",1140
LORD GORING,"Lady Chiltern, allow me.  You wrote me a letter last night in which you said you trusted me and wanted my help.  Now is the moment when you really want my help, now is the time when you have got to trust me, to trust in my counsel and judgment.  You love Robert.  Do you want to kill his love for you?  What sort of existence will he have if you rob him of the fruits of his ambition, if you take him from the splendour of a great political career, if you close the doors of public life against him, if you condemn him to sterile failure, he who was made for triumph and success?  Women are not meant to judge us, but to forgive us when we need forgiveness.  Pardon, not punishment, is their mission.  Why should you scourge him with rods for a sin done in his youth, before he knew you, before he knew himself? A man’s life is of more value than a woman’s.  It has larger issues, wider scope, greater ambitions.  A woman’s life revolves in curves of emotions.  It is upon lines of intellect that a man’s life progresses. Don’t make any terrible mistake, Lady Chiltern.  A woman who can keep a man’s love, and love him in return, has done all the world wants of women, or should want of them.",1142
LORD GORING,"Rather than lose your love, Robert would do anything, wreck his whole career, as he is on the brink of doing now.  He is making for you a terrible sacrifice.  Take my advice, Lady Chiltern, and do not accept a sacrifice so great.  If you do, you will live to repent it bitterly.  We men and women are not made to accept such sacrifices from each other.  We are not worthy of them.  Besides, Robert has been punished enough.",1144
LORD GORING,"Do not for that reason set him down now too low.  If he has fallen from his altar, do not thrust him into the mire.  Failure to Robert would be the very mire of shame. Power is his passion.  He would lose everything, even his power to feel love.  Your husband’s life is at this moment in your hands, your husband’s love is in your hands.  Don’t mar both for him.",1146
LORD GORING,"Oh dear no, Robert.  Your debt is to Lady Chiltern, not to me!",1154
LORD GORING,"Robert, you are your sister’s guardian, and I want your consent to my marriage with her.  That is all.",1156
LORD GORING,"Thank you, Lady Chiltern.",1158
LORD GORING,Yes.,1160
LORD GORING,Sacrificed!,1162
LORD GORING,But I love Mabel.  No other woman has any place in my life.,1164
LORD GORING,What reason have you for saying that?,1167
LORD GORING,Certainly I do.,1169
LORD GORING,I have nothing more to say.,1171
LORD GORING,Lady Chiltern!,1174
LORD GORING,"Well, really, Lady Chiltern, I think I should have back my own letter.",1178
LORD GORING,"Well, I hope she hasn’t changed her mind.  It’s nearly twenty minutes since I saw her last.",1180
LORD GORING,Darling!,1182
LORD GORING,"Certainly, father!  And Chiltern’s been wise enough to accept the seat in the Cabinet.",1184
LORD GORING,"Yes, father, I prefer it domestic.",1189
LORD GORING.  I . .,believe so.,106
MR. MONTFORD,"Like some supper, Mrs. Marchmont?",200
MR. MONTFORD,I don’t know that I like being watched when I am eating!,202
MR. MONTFORD,I don’t know that I should like that either.,204
