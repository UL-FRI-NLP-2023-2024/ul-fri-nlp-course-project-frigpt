She has invested millions in the project, which has been a significant source of national pride and economic boost for Great Britain. Mrs Cheveley's support helped to finance the construction of the canal and the development of ports and infrastructure that will benefit the region for many years to come. Additionally, she has been a powerful lobbyist for the canal's expansion, advocating for the inclusion of new shipping lanes and the expansion of the canal itself. Despite her wealth, Mrs Cheveley's involvement in the canal project is not without controversy. Some critics have argued that it is a waste of public money, given that the canal is already fully functional and can be used for other purposes, such as shipping grain to the Middle East. Nevertheless, Mrs Cheveley's support for the canal project has been a significant boost to Britain's global influence and prestige, making her a powerful figure in world politics.\n",

[_Taking a seat beside her_.]  Seriously?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Quite seriously.  I want to talk to you about a great\\npolitical and financial scheme, about this Argentine Canal Company, in\\nfact.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  What a tedious, practical subject for you to talk\\nabout, Mrs. Cheveley!\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Oh, I like tedious, practical subjects.  What I don’t\\nlike are tedious, practical people.  There is a wide difference.\\nBesides, you are interested, I know, in International Canal schemes.  You\\nwere Lord Radley’s secretary, weren’t you, when the Government bought the\\nSuez Canal shares?', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\Faks\\\\NLP\\\\Project\\\\data\\\\ideal_husband.txt'}), Document(page_content='SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I fear I have no advice to give you, Mrs. Cheveley,\\nexcept to interest yourself in something less dangerous.  The success of\\nthe Canal depends, of course, on the attitude of England, and I am going\\nto lay the report of the Commissioners before the House to-morrow night.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  That you must not do.  In your own interests, Sir Robert,\\nto say nothing of mine, you must not do that.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.

CHEVELEY.  You thought that letter had been destroyed.  How foolish\\nof you!  It is in my possession.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  The affair to which you allude was no more than a\\nspeculation.  The House of Commons had not yet passed the bill; it might\\nhave been rejected.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  It was a swindle, Sir Robert.  Let us call things by\\ntheir proper names.  It makes everything simpler.  And now I am going to\\nsell you that letter, and the price I ask for it is your public support\\nof the Argentine scheme.  You made your own fortune out of one canal.\\nYou must help me and my friends to make our fortunes out of another!\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  It is infamous, what you propose—infamous!\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Oh, no!  This is the game of life as we all have to play\\nit, Sir Robert, sooner or later!\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.
